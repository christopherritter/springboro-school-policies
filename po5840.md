================

It is the policy of the Board of Education that student groups be
recognized as authorized school organizations only if they are approved
by the school administration, sponsored by school-approved personnel,
composed of members of the current student body, hold the majority of
their meetings at school, and have established aims which are
educational in nature.

Membership or participation in the organization or operation of any
fraternity, sorority, or other secret group as described by law is
prohibited throughout the School District. In particular, the Board
shall not tolerate any type of gang or gang-related activity to occur on
District property or while students are under the auspices of the Board.
