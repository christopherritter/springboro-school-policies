<BODY><B><P>5550 - COMMUNITY AGENCY INVESTIGATIONS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education fully supports a safe community and commends the efforts of law enforcement to fight and prevent crime and recognizes the responsibilities of law enforcement and children services to investigate cases of possible abuse or neglect. The Board must balance its support with the privacy rights of students while on school premises. The Board must also provide a safe environment in and around all school facilities.</P>
<P>The Board has tried to balance the above interests in part by the placement of School Resource Officers (SRO) on school property during school hours. The SRO's role is to develop relationships with students, staff, and administration, which will foster trust between the parties. Nothing in this policy prohibits an SRO from speaking with students during the natural course of his/her duties as the SRO.</P>
<P>Nothing in this policy shall prohibit the Superintendent of Schools, after consultation with the building level administrator, to exercise discretion to waive these requirements when s/he deems necessary. Factors that control this discretion include but are not limited to, safety of students, protection of the facility, emergency conditions and natural disasters.</P>
<B><P>Law Enforcement</P></B>
<P>The following procedure applies to instances where a law enforcement officer requests an interview with a student on school premises regarding an incident that occurred in the community:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>An officer should contact and/or question students out of the school setting whenever possible.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>In those situations where it is absolutely necessary for an officer to make an in-school contact with a student, in order to avoid prejudicing that student's rights, no child shall be questioned, interrogated, interviewed, or otherwise spoken to on school premises by an officer unless parental consent is received in advance by the building level administrator or unless a proper court order is presented to the District.</P>
<P>C.</P><P>Parents may be present during the interview if they so desire.</P>
<P>D.</P><P>The building level administrator and/or designee will be present when an interrogation takes place within the school.</P>
<P>E.</P><P>In the event an interview occurs on school premises, reasonable efforts will be made to coordinate the interview with the student's class schedule, to the extent possible, to cause the least disruption to the student's education.</P>
<P>F.</P><P>In the event an officer wishes to speak with a student regarding charges of child abuse or neglect, the administration is under no obligation to notify the student's parents.</P>
<P>The following procedure applies to instances where an incident has occurred on school property or at a school activity, function or field trip:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>The SRO may interview students without notifying parents first, except if the SRO believes there is a reasonable possibility that the interview would lead to criminal charges against the student. In that case, a prior attempt to notify the parents is required.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>The SRO is not required to contact parents if the student is discussing allegations of child abuse or neglect.</P>
<B><P>Children Services</P></B>
<P>Children services conducted interviews will be allowed to take place at school. The building administrator must be advised of the intended visit and be allowed to be an observer at any interview.</P>
<P>Should the child involved request that the particular building administrator be excluded; another administrator, counselor or school nurse shall be included.</P>
<P>The administration is under no obligation to notify the student's parents of a children services investigation or interview.</P>
