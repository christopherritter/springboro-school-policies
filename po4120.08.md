================

The Board of Education may find it necessary to employ, on a part-time
basis, coaches or activity sponsors who are not members of the
professional staff. Such part-time employees may be members of the
District's classified staff or individuals from the community or nearby
areas.

The Board authorizes the Superintendent or his/her designee to recommend
candidates for employment by the Board.

Each coach or activity sponsor shall hold a valid Pupil Activity Program
Permit issued by the State Board of Education under R.C. 3319.303(A),
have any other necessary qualifications, have been properly interviewed,
and shall sign an employment contract which includes the conditions of
employment, compensation arrangements, and contract termination
procedures.

Personnel must also pass a background check performed by the Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (see Policy [**4121**](po4121.md)).

The Board may renew the contract of any nonlicensed individual,
currently employed by the Board for one or more years, without first
offering the position held by that individual to employees of the
District who are licensed individuals or advertising the position as
available to any qualified licensed individuals who are not currently
employed by the Board unless otherwise prohibited by a collective
bargaining agreement.
