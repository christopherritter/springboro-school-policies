================

The Board of Education recognizes the need to establish positions which,
when filled by competent, qualified staff members, will assist the
District in achieving the educational goals set by the Board. The
District employs only U.S. Citizens and others lawfully authorized to
work in the United States.

The Board reserves the right to create new positions and provide each
with a job description of essential functions for which the position was
created and provide each with a title that conforms with the appropriate
certification insofar as possible.

The Superintendent, shall recommend to the Board the advisability of
creating a new position or of changing the number of employees in an
existing position.
