<BODY><B><P>4170 - SUBSTANCE ABUSE</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes alcoholism and drug abuse as treatable illnesses. Such illnesses may impair the performance of an employee. The Board may require the employee enroll in a recognized program of treatment as a condition of continued employment. The employee's job security will not be jeopardized by participating in a program but the Board shall be under no obligation to retain the employee if the treatment program is not successful.</P>
<P>A noncertificated staff member having an illness or other problem relating to the use of alcohol or other drugs including, controlled substances, medications not prescribed by the employee’s physician, or medications not taken as prescribed, will receive the same careful consideration and offer of assistance that is presently extended to noncertificated staff having any other illness.</P>
<P>The responsibility to correct unsatisfactory job performance, attendance, or behavioral problems resulting from a suspected health problem rests with the noncertificated employee. Additionally, regardless of whether a classified staff member has an illness or other problem relating to the use of alcohol or other drugs it remains the responsibility of the classified staff member to report to work and perform his/her duties in a fit and appropriate condition at all times. Being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs while on duty, on school property, or at a school related activity/event is not acceptable. Failure to correct unsatisfactory job performance, attendance, or behavior, and/or working or reporting to work under the influence of alcohol or other drugs will result in appropriate corrective or disciplinary action as determined by the Board, up to and including termination.</P>
<P>If a classified staff member sustains a workplace injury while s/he is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance not prescribed by his/her physician, s/he may be disqualified for compensation and benefits under the Workers Compensation Act. If the classified staff member tests positive or refuses to submit to a test for alcohol and/or other drugs after sustaining a workplace injury, the employee may dispute or prove untrue the presumption or belief that alcohol and/or other drugs are the proximate cause of the injury (i.e., rebuttable presumption). The Board directs the Superintendent to establish guidelines and post a notice advising employees that the results of, or the employees refusal to submit to an alcohol or other drug test may affect an employee’s right to receive workers’ compensation benefits.</P>
<P>If a classified staff member voluntarily requests counseling or assistance before the Board learns of the classified staff member's substance abuse problem (through a positive test result or otherwise), the classified staff member's job security or promotion opportunities will not be jeopardized by his/her request for counseling or referral assistance. A support staff member may not avoid the consequences of a positive test by requesting counseling or assistance for a substance abuse problem after being instructed to submit to a drug test.</P>
<P>Employees who are concerned that they may have an alcoholism or other drug abuse problem are encouraged to seek counseling and information on a confidential basis by contacting resources available for such service.</P>
<P>Medical records of employees with drinking or other drug abuse problems will be preserved with the same degree of confidence as all other medical records.</P>
