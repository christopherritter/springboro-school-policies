<H3>7530.01 - STAFF USE OF CELLULAR TELEPHONES</H3>
<P>The Board of Education will provide cellular telephones to employees who by the nature of their job have a routine and continuing business need for the use of same for official Board business. Cellular telephones are provided as a tool to conduct Board business and to enhance business efficiencies.</P>
<P>The Board requires specified staff members to be accessible by telephone when and if the need arises. Cellular telephone technology enables individuals to be reached whenever a situation arises necessitating immediate contact and communication, regardless of the person’s location at the time. Therefore, a Board-owned cellular telephone may be issued to the Superintendent as well as other specified staff members.</P>
<P>Since specified staff members are expected to be readily accessible day and night, seven (7) days a week during the course of their employment, the Board considers cellular telephones to be essential equipment for the performance of their duties, and believes that the provision of same to the aforementioned staff members serves a valid public purpose.</P>
<P>Cellular telephone calls are not secure. Therefore, employees should use discretion in relaying confidential information, particularly as it relates to students.</P>
<P>Employees must safeguard any Board-owned cellular telephone in their possession. Reasonable precautions should be made to prevent equipment loss, damage, theft and vandalism. Upon resignation or termination of employment, or at any time upon request, the employee may be asked to produce the equipment for return or inspection. Employees unable to present the equipment in good working condition within the time period requested (e.g., twenty-four (24) hours) may be expected to bear the cost of a replacement. Employees who separate from employment with outstanding debts for equipment loss or unauthorized charges will be considered to have left employment on unsatisfactorily terms and may be subject to legal action for recovery of the loss.</P>
<P>The Board reserves the right to audit all Board-owned cellular telephones and their use, which will include but not be limited to, a review of the monthly bill by the Business Manager. Board cellular telephones and cellular service account statements, invoices, and payment documents are public records and, as such, may be subject to disclosure and review.</P>
<P>The Superintendent and other specified staff members shall not be billed for local and long distance calls of a personal nature made from their cellular telephone, provided the personal calls do not result in additional charges beyond the usual and customary charge associated with the staff member’s plan. The Board determines that this/these expenditure(s) serve a public purpose given the accessibility required of the individual(s) required to have a Board-owned cellular telephone. If, however, the personal calls result in excess charges, then the staff member shall be billed for any charges in excess of the base plan amount.</P>
<P>Board employees may carry personal cellular telephones with them while on Board time and/or while operating Board equipment, but are subject to the following restrictions:</P>
<P>A. Excessive use of a personal cellular telephone for personal business during work hours is considered outside the employee’s scope of employment.</P>
<P>B. Employees are responsible for operating Board-owned vehicles and potentially hazardous equipment in a safe and prudent manner, and therefore, employees should refrain from using personal cellular telephones while operating such vehicle or equipment.</P>
<P>C. The Board assumes no liability for loss or damage to employees’ personal cellular telephones carried in Board vehicles or left on Board property. Employees assume the risk of loss or damage to personal cellular telephones carried by employees during working hours.</P>
