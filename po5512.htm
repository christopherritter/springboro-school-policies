<H3>5512 - USE OF TOBACCO</H3>
<P>The Board of Education is committed to providing students, staff, and visitors with an indoor tobacco and smoke-free environment. The negative health effects of tobacco use for both the users and nonusers, particularly in connection with second hand smoke, are well established. Further, providing a non-smoking and tobacco-free environment is consistent with the responsibilities of teachers and staff to be positive role models for our students.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "use of tobacco" means to chew or maintain any substance containing tobacco, including smokeless tobacco, in the mouth to derive the effects of tobacco, as well as all uses of tobacco or tobacco substitutes, including cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, or any other matter or substances that contain tobacco, in addition to papers used to roll cigarettes and/or the smoking of electronic, &quot;vapor,&quot; or other substitute forms of cigarettes, clove cigarettes or other lighted smoking devices for burning tobacco or any other substance.</P>
<P>In order to protect students and staff who choose not to use tobacco from an environment noxious to them, the Board prohibits the possession, consumption, purchase or attempt to purchase and/or use of tobacco or tobacco substitute products by students on Board premises, in Board-owned vehicles, within any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by the Board, and/or used to provide education or library services to children, and at all Board-sponsored events. </P>
<P>Students who violate this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct/Student Discipline Code and in accordance with policies of the Board.</P>
