5810 - STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN DECISION MAKING
=============================================

The Board of Education recognizes the value of student participation in
decision making for the school system. As the principle consumer of the
educational process, the student is in an unique position to contribute
to the evaluation of school programs.

Students will be encouraged to attend Board meetings and participate in
discussions.

Students also will be encouraged to assist in the formulation of policy
for the school system.

In the development of administrative guidelines and arrangements for the
operation of the school system, the Superintendent shall include at the
planning stage, whenever feasible and appropriate, representatives of
those students who will be affected by such provisions.

The Superintendent will establish procedures by which students can
readily communicate their ideas and opinions regarding the operation of
the school system.

The Board authorizes the establishment of class and school governmental
organizations, including student associations or councils, in keeping
with the students' level of maturity, to offer practice in
self-government, and to serve as channels for the expression of student
opinion.
