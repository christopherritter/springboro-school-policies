8740 - BONDING
==============

The Board of Education recognizes that prudent trusteeship of the
resources of this District dictate that employees responsible for the
safekeeping of District monies and property be bonded.

The District shall be indemnified against loss of money and property by
bonding of employees holding those positions and in the amounts
designated by the Board.

All other employees handling money shall be covered under a blanket bond
to the amount of at least \$10,000.

The Board shall bear the cost of bonding each employee required to be
bonded by this policy or by statute.
