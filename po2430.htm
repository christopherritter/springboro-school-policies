<TITLE>2430 - CO-CURRICULAR AND EXTRA-CURRICULAR PROGRAMS</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>2430 - CO-CURRICULAR AND EXTRA-CURRICULAR PROGRAMS</H1><P>The Board of Education believes that the fulfillment of the District Mission Statement may best be achieved through a variety of learning experiences, some of which are more appropriately conducted outside of the regular classroom curricular program of the school. The Board of Education encourages participation in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, so long as time requirements do not jeopardize student success in core academic studies. For the purpose of identifying the different types of activities, the following definitions are hereby adopted:</P>
<P>A. <B>Sponsored Activity<BR><P>
<P>Activities formally approved by the School District and supervised by School District employees in the course of their employment or by approved volunteers.</P>
<P>B. <B>Approved Activities<BR><P>
<P>Activities formally approved by the School District which are not supervised by District employees in the course of their employment or by approved volunteers.</P>
<P>C. <B>Independent Activities<BR><P>
<P>Activities involving students that have not been approved by the School District and for which the District assumes no responsibility.</P>
<P>D. <B>Curricular Activities<BR><P>
<P>Those District-sponsored activities taking place during school hours.</P>
<P>E. <B>Co-Curricular Activities<BR><P>
<P>Those activities conducted on or off school premises by clubs, associations, and organizations of students sponsored by the Board which receive or spend at least $50 in the school year but not including athletic competitions and practices. In addition, at least a portion of an academic grade is a result of participation in said activity.</P>
<P>F. <B>Extra-Curricular Activities<BR><P>
<P>Those activities conducted on or off school premises predominately after the regular school day. Activities requiring eligibility include marching band, cheerleaders, drill team, flag corp., winter guard, winter percussion, drama and all interscholastic athletic programs.</P>
<P>G. <B>Nonathletic Activities<BR><P>
<P>Those activities whose purpose does not include the physical development of the student.</P>
<P>H. <B>District-Sanctioned Activities<BR><P>
<P>In addition to extra-curricular activities it sponsors, the Board may, from time to time, choose to permit certain activities which are not part of the regular extra-curricular program of the District but which can benefit those students who wish to participate. Although permitting an activity, the Board will not assume any responsibility for its planning, conduct, or evaluation.<BR><P>
<P>The Board may make facilities available in accordance with its Policy <A HREF='po7510.htm'><B>7510</B></A> - Use of Facilities.<BR><P>
<P>No organization may use the name of the District or any other name which would associate the activity with the District without the consent of the Board. Requests for such consent must be submitted to the Superintendent and receive his/her recommendation prior to consideration by the Board.</P>
<P>I. <B>Nondistrict-Sponsored Student Clubs and Activities<BR><P>
<P>The Board shall allow nondistrict-sponsored student clubs and activities during non-instructional time, in accordance with the provision in Policy <A HREF='po5730.htm'><B>5730</B></A> - Equal Access for Nondistrict-Sponsored Student Clubs and Activities.</P>
<P>The conduct of activities which are neither sponsored nor approved is not the responsibility of the School District, even though such activities may be permitted to utilize school buildings or other District facilities in accord with Board policy. The Superintendent shall at all times maintain a current list of sponsored and approved activities.</P>
<P>The Board believes that properly structured, well-managed co-curricular activities can both supplement and reinforce the District's curricular programs. Co-curricular activities must be related to curriculum but not offered for credit toward promotion or graduation and are not ordinarily conducted during the regular school day. No co-curricular activity shall be considered to be under the sponsorship of this Board unless its relationship to one (1) or more courses of study has been demonstrated and the activity has been approved by the Board on recommendation of the Superintendent. The following policies are intended to provide guidance to those who design and operate these programs.</P>
<H3>ELIGIBILITY</H3>
<P>All approved or sponsored activities shall be open to all students enrolled in the District who are capable of satisfying reasonable criteria for admission and continuing participation, as determined by the Superintendent, or as recommended by the athletic council and approved by the Board.</P>
<P>Unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent, participation in one activity shall not be made a prerequisite for participation in another activity.</P>
<P>With regard to interscholastic athletic activities, the Superintendent shall determine the standards of eligibility to be met by all students wishing to participate. Further, in grades 7 - 12, coaches, directors, and advisors may adopt, subject to review by the Superintendent, fair and reasonable standards to limit participation to those persons who are most likely to be successful in competition, both individually and as a team member. Such standards shall at a minimum require that each student be in good physical condition, be free of injury, and shall have fully recovered from any illness.</P>
<P>Additionally, unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent, students in grades K-8 shall not participate, in co-curricular, extra-curricular, or athletic activities conducted for students in grades 9-12. Similarly, students in grades 9-12 shall not participate in co-curricular, extra-curricular, or athletic activities conducted for students in grades K-8.</P>
<P>Participation in activities requiring eligibility, as defined in item F on page 1 of this policy, shall be limited to students who meet the following criteria:</P>
<P>A. must have completed the sixth grade</P>
<P>B. must be currently enrolled in grades 9-12 and must have been enrolled in school the immediately preceding grading period; received passing grades during that grading period in subjects that earned a minimum of 5.0 credits, or the equivalent, per year toward graduation; and must have at least a 67% average or the equivalent for the preceding grading period.</P>
<P>C. must be enrolled in grades seven and eight and must have been enrolled in school the immediately preceding grading period; received passing grades in at least seventy-five percent (75%) of all subjects and have at least a 70% average or the equivalent for the preceding grading period; except for a student enrolled in grade seven (7) for the first time or if they were eligible at a previous school, shall be eligible for the initial grading period regardless of previous academic achievement.</P>
<P>D. in season students, with the exception of drama, must maintain weekly eligibility. Any student receiving more than one (1) Unsatisfactory behavioral grade and/or any grade equivalent to less than a 67% average in grades 9 – 12 or 70% average in grades 7 – 8 in two (2) different subjects will result in loss of eligibility for one (1) week. Students can not lose eligibility during the first week of a grading period. A student who lost eligibility in the last week of a grading period is ineligible during the first week of the next grading period.</P>
<P>E. must demonstrate good citizenship, and exercise responsibility toward self and others</P>
<P>F. must have returned all school and athletic equipment as required</P>
<P>G. must not be currently subject to out-of-school suspension</P>
<P>H. must satisfy any other requirements recommended by the athletic council and approved by the Board</P>
<P>The District Athletic Council and the Superintendent shall annually review these eligibility requirements with the intent of evaluating the student's grade point average as a requirement for eligibility. Recommendations regarding changes in eligibility standards shall be made as necessary no later than February of each year.</P>
<P>A student who has received a failing grade for any one class or course in the School District's graded course of study for the previous grading period shall not be prohibited from participating in co-curricular, extra-curricular, or athletic activities if s/he meets the criteria specified above. A student who receives a failing grade for more than one (1) class or course shall be prohibited from participating, however.</P>
<P>Participation in athletic activities or activities requiring travel off school property shall require prior written approval of parent or guardian and waiver of liability on a form approved by the Superintendent.</P>
<H3>ATHLETIC PROGRAM GUIDELINES</H3>
<P>The Superintendent shall develop appropriate administrative guidelines for the operation of the athletic program and a Code of Conduct for those who participate. Such guidelines should provide for the following safeguards:</P>
<P>A. Prior to enrolling in the sport, each participant shall submit to a thorough physical examination by a licensed physician and their parents shall report any past or current health problems along with a physician's statement that any such problems have or are being treated and pose no threat to the student's participation.</P>
<P>B. Any student who is found to have a health condition which may be life-threatening to self or others shall not be allowed to participate until the situation has been analyzed by a medial review panel that has determined the conditions under which the student may participate. The District shall assume no liability for any student with a health condition who has been authorized to play by the parents and their physician.</P>
<P>C. Any student who incurs an injury requiring a physician's licensed care is to have a new physical examination by a licensed physician prior to the student's return to participation. Said physician shall provide a written notice allowing return to participate.</P>
<P>D. In order to minimize health and safety risks to student-athletes and maintain ethical standards, school personnel, coaches, athletic trainers, and volunteer coaches, should never dispense, supply, recommend, or permit the use of any drug, medication, or food supplement.</P>
<P>E. The Superintendent is also to develop guidelines for ensuring that sportsmanship, ethics, and integrity characterize the manner in which the athletic program is conducted and the actions of students who participate.</P>
<H3>SUPERVISION</H3>
<P>School District employees or approved volunteers who supervise co-curricular activities shall hold one of the following titles:</P>
<P>A. <B>Coach<BR><P>
<P>Supervises athletic activities involving a competitive sport.</P>
<P>B. <B>Director<BR><P>
<P>Supervises athletic and non-athletic musical activities.</P>
<P>C. <B>Advisor<BR><P>
<P>Supervises athletic and nonathletic activities which are neither musical nor competitive.</P>
<H3>ACTIVITIES ON DAYS SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED FOR WEATHER CONDITIONS</H3>
<P>Co-curricular and athletic activities on days that schools are closed because of severe weather or other emergencies shall be held only after approval of the Superintendent or his/her designee. In the event that the Superintendent or his/her designee approve activities, then each principal shall be responsible for directing the scheduling of activities that provide fair access for all groups during the time school buildings are available for use. Activity times will be scheduled as close as possible to the normal school day time. Under no circumstances shall coaches or advisors transport students to and from activities on days that schools are closed for weather conditions or other emergencies.</P>
<H3>SAME-DAY ABSENCES</H3>
<P>A student must attend the entire school day in order to participate in an extra-curricular activity scheduled for that afternoon or evening unless receiving the written permission of the building principal. Before giving such permission, the principal shall assure that such permission will not jeopardize the health of the student or other students and that such permission is in the best interests of both the student and the affected activity.</P>
<H3>FAMILY VACATIONS AND TRAVEL</H3>
<P>The Board recognizes the importance of family unity and the educational value of family travel to destinations outside the local community. Therefore, a student's participation in extra-curricular or co-curricular activities may not be limited on the basis of missed practices or competitions occurring during a family approved vacation or trip. However, the coach, director, or advisor may limit participation after the student's return if the student's absence in fact resulted in a material lack of preparedness or physical conditioning. If any limitation is imposed, the coach, director, or advisor shall immediately advise the student of the nature of, and reason(s) for, such limits, and shall assist the student in normalizing his/her level of participation as quickly as possible. Prior to missing practice or upon return to the practice, the student shall present a written statement signed by the parent or guardian.</P>
<H3>SELECTION OF COACHES, DIRECTORS, AND ADVISORS</H3>
<P>Whether employed by the District or approved volunteers, such persons hold an important responsibility for the personal growth and well-being of each participating student.</P>
<P>Every coach, director, and advisor is expected to provide guidance to students through both instruction and example, in a manner which clearly supports the District's philosophy of education specifically:</P>
<P>A. promoting the development of a strong and positive sense of self-worth in each participant;</P>
<P>B. motivating each individual student by creating building blocks of successful activity.</P>
<P>Coaches, directors, and advisors will be largely evaluated on the basis of their success in meeting the needs of students in the above areas. Coaches, directors, and advisors whose motivational techniques are negative, verbally abusive, derogatory, or predominantly disciplinary will not satisfy the requirements of the School District, regardless of their competitive success.</P>
<H3>Team Physicians</H3>
<P>To ensure the well-being of students participating in inter-scholastic athletics, the Board authorizes the Superintendent to arrange for a team physician(s) for those athletic activities in which injury is most likely to occur. The Board directs that only one (1) physician be assigned to each event, although more than one (1) physician may be used on a rotating basis to cover the various events. Additionally, the Board shall not recognize other health professionals such as dentists, optometrist, etc., in a "team" capacity.</P>
<P>Each approved team physician must:</P>
<P>A. be licensed to practice medicine in the State of Ohio;</P>
<P>B. be a resident of and/or practice in the District;</P>
<P>C. agree to serve on a voluntary basis;</P>
<P>D. provide documentation of adequate malpractice insurance;</P>
<P>E. agree to abide by relevant Board policies and administrative procedures of the Superintendent.</P>
