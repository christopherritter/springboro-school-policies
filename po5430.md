{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education acknowledges the usefulness of a system of
computing grade point averages and class ranking for high school
graduates, both to inform students of their relative academic placement
among their peers and to provide students, prospective employers, and
institutions of higher learning with a predictive device so that each
student is more likely to be placed in an environment conducive to
success.

The Board authorizes a system of class ranking, by grade point average,
for students in grade(s) 9-12.

All students shall be ranked together.

Any two (2) or more students whose computed grade point averages are
identical shall be given the same rank. The rank of the student who
immediately follows a tied position will be determined by the number of
students preceding him/her and not by the rank of the person preceding
him/her.

A student's grade point average and rank in class shall be entered on
his/her record and shall be subject to the Board's policy on release of
student records.

Rank in class shall be entered on students' records and on all
transcripts where they will be available for review by authorized
persons.

The Superintendent shall develop procedures for the computation of grade
point averages and the assignment of rank in class.
