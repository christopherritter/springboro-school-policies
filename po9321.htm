<H3>9321 - FINGERPRINTING STUDENTS</H3>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes the advantage to both parents and law enforcement agencies of a means of identifying children who have become lost or been abducted. Accordingly, the Board will cooperate with local law enforcement authorities in fingerprinting students enrolled in the schools of this District.</P>
<P>The Board will make school facilities available for the fingerprinting of children by law enforcement officers and will notify the parent or guardian of each eligible child that the service is available. The notice will clearly state that fingerprinting is voluntary and that no adverse consequences will result from a parent or guardian's refusal or neglect to consent to the fingerprinting of his/her child.</P>
<P>The Board will permit the fingerprinting of only those children who present the written consent of their parent or guardian. An adult student may submit his/her own written consent.</P>
<P>Fingerprint records shall be given to the parent or guardian of the child fingerprinted or to the adult student. No record of fingerprints shall be retained by this Board and no record shall be made or retained to identify those children who were fingerprinted or of those who declined to be fingerprinted.</P>
<P>R.C. 3313.96</P>
