8210 - SCHOOL CALENDAR
======================

The Board of Education recognizes that the preparation of a calendar for
the instructional program of the schools is necessary for orderly
educational planning and for the efficient operation of the District.

The Board shall determine annually the days when the school shall be in
session for instructional purposes.

Such school calendar shall consist of at least the statutory
requirements including such time for early dismissal, parent-teacher
conferences, professional meetings, and public calamities as is allowed
by law and up to three (3) days in order to allow gradual orientation of
kindergarten students.

Annually, no later than March, the Superintendent shall prepare a school
calendar for Board consideration. Each calendar should be approved
fifteen (15) to twenty-four (24) months prior to the actual school year
of use.

The Board reserves the right to alter the school calendar.
