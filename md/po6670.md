6670 - PUBLIC SCHOOL SUPPORT FUND
=================================

The Public School Support Fund is intended to function like a small
general fund applicable to each building and operating on a school
fiscal year.

Receipts for the Public School Support Fund are anticipated from sale of
goods and services including but not limited to pictures, vending
machines, assemblies, food supplies, books, and carnivals. Receipts may
also be obtained through third party donations, dues, fees, and other
charges.

Disbursements from the Public School Support Fund are anticipated from
the need to disburse funds for the purchase of goods and services to
support individual buildings' curricular, co-curricular, and
extra-curricular programs including but not limited to purchased
services, supplies, equipment, repairs and maintenance, contract
services, and other objects in accordance with U.S.A.S. (Uniform School
Accounting System). Such disbursements must have a direct and obvious
benefit to students. Expenditures from the Public School Support Fund
must be approved by the Superintendent. The Treasurer must assure
expenditures are allowable under this policy and USAS guidelines.
