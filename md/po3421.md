===============

The Board of Education realizes the concern of its employees for the
availability of those protective and personally advantageous benefits
beyond an individual's basic salary. It is the Board's desire to make
available or provide, within the limits of law and sound fiscal
management, those which are beneficial to the employee and the District.
