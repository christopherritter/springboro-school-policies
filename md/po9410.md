9410 - NEWS MEDIA RELATIONS
===========================

Representatives of the local press, radio, and TV are an important link
in the communications chain between school and community. The
maintenance of good working relationships with these persons is
essential to meeting those objectives of the school-community relations
program which require the support and cooperation of the media
representatives.

The Board of Education authorizes the development of a sound working
relationship between the news media and the District, based on mutual
respect and cooperation.
