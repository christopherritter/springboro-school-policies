2421.01 - STUDENTS AS TRAINEES
==============================

The Board of Education recognizes the value to providing students with
experiences as part of their preparation for productive employment and
appreciates the cooperation of local employers in accommodating such
training activities at their places of business.

Board policy 2421 authorizes the Superintendent to develop work-site
training programs as part of the vocational education curriculum. S/He
shall develop administrative guidelines whereby all such programs are
reviewed to determine whether or not an employer relationship has been
established according to criteria established by the Supreme Court in
adjudicating cases related to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Particular
attention should be paid to community-based programs for special
education students and to vocational education programs in which
students are producing goods or services for sale and the District is
the recipient of the income therefrom.
