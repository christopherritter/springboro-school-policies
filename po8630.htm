<H1>8630 - STUDENT TRANSPORTATION SAFETY AND WELFARE</H1>
<P>The Board of Education requires that student safety and welfare be ensured during the time students are being bused to school. The Board holds that busing is a privilege, not a right, which may be denied any student who violates the rules of the District, or who conducts himself/herself in a manner which is considered dangerous to persons or property or a threat to the safe operation of the school bus.</P>
<P>The school bus driver shall be responsible for maintaining order and discipline of students while they are being transported to or from school. When a problem in student conduct requires discipline, the driver shall report it in writing to the building principal. A student may be suspended from bus transportation by the principal for disciplinary reasons in which case the parents are responsible for the student's transportation.</P>
<P>Students suspended from bus transportation shall be given written notice of their suspension and the reasons therefor, and an opportunity to appear at an informal hearing to answer the charges against them. Students whose conduct on the bus is so grievous as to consider expulsion from bus transportation shall be provided with the hearing privileges indicated in the student code of conduct.</P>
<P>Students whose conduct on the bus is an immediate danger to persons or property or a threat to the safe operation of the school bus may be immediately removed from the vehicle and shall be given notice as soon as practicable of a hearing which must be held within seventy-two (72) hours of the removal.</P>
<P>The Superintendent or designee shall:</P>
<P>A. prepare student school bus management regulations which shall include as a minimum the rules specified in A.C. 3301-83-08(C) and A.C. 3301-83-20;</P>
<P>B. prepare a course of safety instruction for students in grades kindergarten through third who are regularly transported to school in accordance with A.C. 3301-83-09;</P>
<P>C. maintain records for the management and reporting of the student transportation program in accordance with A.C. 3301-83-14;</P>
<P>D. prepare a pre-emergency plan for routine and nonroutine operation in cooperation with all persons whose services would be required in the event of an emergency in accordance with A.C. 3301-83-15.</P>
