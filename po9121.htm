<H3>9121 - TAPING OF BOARD MEETINGS</H3>
<P>Audio and video recording devices may be used at regular and special Board of Education meetings legally open to the public according to the following guidelines:</P>
<H3>Independent Recording</H3>
<P>A. Tape recording of Board meetings, by individuals other than those designated/authorized by the Board, is permitted; however, any individual(s) desiring to do so must advise the Board and all persons present at the meeting that such recording is being made.</P>
<P>B. Persons operating recording devices must do so with a minimum of disruption to the Board proceedings and a minimum of interference to those present at the meeting. Specifically, a view between Board members and the audience must not be obstructed, interviews shall not be conducted during the meeting, and no commentary is to be given in a manner that is audible to those in attendance or conducting the meeting and thereby distracts Board members or the audience.</P>
<P>C. The Board has the right to prohibit any individual from taping who violates the restrictions contained in item number 2 above.</P>
<P>D. Individuals who make audio/video tape recordings of Board public meetings, except individuals designated/authorized by the Board to do so on behalf of the Board, are responsible for securing whatever permissions, releases, etc., may be necessary, if any, for broadcasting, or otherwise using any such recorded materials. It is understood that any permission the Board has secured to use any copyrighted or licensed material for Board purposes does not provide individuals not in the employ of the Board with the right to use, broadcast, or otherwise disseminate such materials. Accordingly, such individuals shall assume any liability for broadcasting or disseminating any such materials without first securing any individual releases, copyright releases required, if any, and further assumes all liability arising out of the broadcasting or disseminating of such materials and the nature of the content of the recordings.</P>
