</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>It is the policy of the Board of Education to maintain an education and work environment which is free from all forms of unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment.  This commitment applies to all School District operations, programs, and activities.  All students, administrators, teachers, staff, and all other school personnel share responsibility for avoiding, discouraging, and reporting any form of unlawful harassment.  This policy applies to unlawful conduct occurring on school property, or at another location if such conduct occurs during an activity sponsored by the Board.</P>
<P>The Board will vigorously enforce its prohibition against harassment based on sex, race, color, national origin, religion, disability, genetic information, or any other unlawful basis, and encourages those within the School District community as well as third parties, who feel aggrieved to seek assistance to rectify the problems.  The Board will investigate all allegations of harassment and in those cases where unlawful harassment is substantiated, the Board will take immediate steps to end the harassment.  Individuals who are found to have engaged in unlawful harassment will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "School District community" means students, administrators, teachers, staff, and all other school personnel, including Board members, agents, volunteers, contractors, or other persons subject to the control and supervision of the Board.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "third parties" include, but are not limited to, guests and/or visitors on School District property (e.g., visiting speakers, participants on opposing athletic teams, parents), vendors doing business with, or seeking to do business with, the Board, and other individuals who come in contact with members of the School District community at school-related events/activities (whether on or off School District property).</P>

Such harassment may occur where conduct is directed at the characteristics of a person's disabling condition, such as negative comments about speech patterns, movement, physical impairments or defects/appearances, or the like.  Such harassment may further occur where conduct is directed at or pertains to a person's genetic information.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Reports and Complaints of Harassing Conduct</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>Members of the School District community and third parties are encouraged to promptly report incidents of harassing conduct to an administrator, supervisor or other School District official so that the Board may address the conduct before it becomes severe, pervasive, or persistent.</P>
<P>Members of the School District community or third parties who believe they have been unlawfully harassed by another member of the School District community or a third party are entitled to utilize the Board's informal and/or formal investigation and complaint processes.  Initiating a complaint, whether formally or informally, will not adversely affect the complaining individual's employment or participation in educational or extra-curricular programs.  While there are no time limits for initiating complaints of harassment under this policy, individuals should make every effort to file an informal or a formal complaint as soon as possible after the conduct occurs while the facts are known and potential witnesses are available.</P>
<P>The names and titles of the Anti-Harassment Complaint Coordinators with whom complaints of sexual and other forms of unlawful harassment should be filed are set forth in the administrative guidelines which supplement this policy.  The names and titles of these individuals will be published annually in the parent and staff handbooks and/or School District Annual Report to the public</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall establish Administrative Guidelines describing both a formal and an informal process for making a charge of harassment, a process for investigating claims of harassment, and a process for rendering a decision regarding whether the claim of harassment was substantiated.  This Policy and the Administrative Guidelines will be readily available to all members of the School District community and posted in appropriate places throughout the School District.</P>
<P>Any Board employee who directly observes unlawful harassment of a student is obligated, in accordance with this policy, to report such observations to one of the Complaint Coordinators.  Thereafter, the Complaint Coordinator must contact the student, if over age eighteen (18) or the student's parents if under the age eighteen&nbsp;(18), to advise s/he/them of the Board's intent to investigate the alleged misconduct, including the obligation of the Complaint Coordinator or designee to conduct an investigation following all the procedures outlined for a formal complaint.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Confidentiality</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>The School District will make reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the parties involved in a harassment investigation.  Confidentiality, however, cannot be guaranteed.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Informal Process for Addressing Complaints of Harassment</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>The administrative guidelines will include an informal complaint process to provide members of the School District community or third parties who believe they are being unlawfully harassed with a range of options designed to bring about a resolution of their concerns.  Members of the School District community or third parties who believe that they have been unlawfully harassed are encouraged to initiate their complaint through this informal complaint process, but are not required to do so.  Those members of the School District community or third parties who believe that they have been unlawfully harassed may proceed immediately to the formal complaint process and individuals who seek resolution through the informal procedure may request that the informal process be terminated at any time to move to the formal complaint process.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Formal Process for Addressing Complaints of Harassment</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>The administrative guidelines will also include a formal complaint process.  While the formal complaint process may serve as the first step to resolution of a charge of unlawful harassment, it is also available in those circumstances when the informal complaint process fails to satisfactorily resolve a concern.  Because of the need for flexibility, no specific time lines are established for initiating the formal complaint process; however, once the formal complaint process is begun, the investigation will be completed in a timely manner (ordinarily, within thirty-one (31) calendar days of the complaint being received).</P>
<P>Although not required, members of the School District community or third parties who feel they have been unlawfully harassed should file a formal written complaint with the principal of their school building or with one of the Complaint Coordinators identified in the Administrative Guidelines.  Oral complaints of harassment will be reduced to writing by the individual receiving the complaint and the Complainant will be asked to verify the accuracy of the reported charge by signing the document.  Complaints received by a school building principal will be immediately reported to the appropriate Complaint Coordinator identified in the Administrative Guidelines.</P>
<P>After a complaint is filed, the Complaint Coordinator or designee shall conduct a prompt and timely investigation.  The investigation may include interviews of the complainant, the individual accused of engaging in harassing behavior, and any other witness who may reasonably be expected to have information relevant to the situation.  All interviewed parties and witnesses will be provided an opportunity to present any evidence that they reasonably believe to be relevant to the situation.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of the investigation the Complaint Coordinator or designee will prepare and deliver to the Superintendent a written report summarizing the evidence gathered during the investigation and providing his/her recommendations regarding whether or not the complaint of unlawful harassment has been substantiated.  The written report must be based on the totality of the circumstances involved in the complaint, the nature of the alleged conduct, the context in which the alleged conduct occurred, and the ages and maturity of the individuals involved.</P>
<P>A copy of the written report will also be delivered to the member of the School District community or third party making the complaint and the individual accused of the harassing conduct.</P>
<P>Upon review of the written report the Superintendent will either issue a final decision regarding whether or not the complaint of unlawful harassment was substantiated, or request that further investigation be conducted.  A copy of Superintendent's action will be delivered to both the Complainant and the individual accused of the harassing conduct.</P>
<P>The decision of the Superintendent shall be final.</P>
<P>The Complaint process set forth in the policy and in the administrative guidelines is not intended to interfere with the rights of a member of the School District community or a third party to pursue a complaint of unlawful harassment with the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</P>
<P>The Board reserves the right to investigate and resolve a complaint or report of unlawful harassment regardless of whether the member of the School District community or third party alleging the harassment pursues the complaint.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Sanctions and Monitoring</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>The Board shall vigorously enforce its prohibitions against unlawful harassment.  While observing the principles of due process, a violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including the discharge of an employee or the suspension/expulsion of a student.  All disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with applicable State law and the terms of the relevant collective bargaining agreement(s).  When imposing discipline, the Superintendent shall consider the totality of the circumstances involved in the matter, including the ages and maturity levels of those involved.  In those cases where unlawful harassment is not substantiated, the Board may consider whether the alleged conduct nevertheless warrants discipline in accordance with other Board policies, consistent with the terms of the relevant collective bargaining agreement(s).</P>
<P>Where the Board becomes aware that a prior remedial action has been taken against a member of the School District community, all subsequent sanctions imposed by the Board and/or Superintendent shall be reasonably calculated to eliminate such conduct in the future.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3><P>Education and Training</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>In support of this Anti-Harassment Policy, the Board promotes preventative educational measures to create greater awareness of unlawful discriminatory practices.  The Superintendent or designee shall provide appropriate training to all members of the School District community related to the implementation of this policy and its accompanying administrative guidelines.  All training regarding the Board's policy and administrative guidelines and harassment in general, will be age and content appropriate.</P>
