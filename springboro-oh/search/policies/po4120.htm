</B></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>
<P>Employment of all personnel will be by the Board of Education upon the recommendation of the Superintendent.  Upon formal action of the Board to employ a staff member, a written contract will be entered into between the Board and the employee for the services and compensation associated with the specific position.</P>
<P>The Board shall approve the employment, and also, when not covered by the terms of a negotiated, collectively-bargained agreement, fix the compensation and establish the term of employment for each noncertificated staff member employed by the Board.</P>
<P>Relatives of Board members may be employed by the Board, provided the member of the Board involved does not participate in any way in the discussion or vote on the employment of his/her relative.  All such persons shall be employed only if they are the best candidate for the position and not on the basis of the relationship to a Board member.</P>
<P>Spouses of current employees of the Board may be considered for employment in the District, providing there is no direct superior/subordinate relationship between the couple in the work environment.</P>
<P>Applications for employment will not be accepted from any current Board member.  If a Board member wishes to apply for a position, his/her resignation must be accepted by the Board prior to submitting an application, and the Board member must not use or attempt to use his/her official authority or influence to secure the employment position.</P>
<P>Any employee misstatement of fact material to qualifications for employment or the determination of salary shall be considered by this Board to constitute grounds for dismissal.</P>
<P>The Superintendent may, upon advance notice of the Board, authorize selected staff to begin work prior to approval by the Board when their employment is required to maintain continuity in the support services program.  Employment shall be recommended to the Board at the next regular meeting.</P>
<P>All staff appointed by the Board are required to supply the Superintendent evidence of proper certification, as required, and evidence of a negative TB test.</P>
<P>Noncertificated staff members also must pass a background check performed by the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (see Policy <A HREF='po4121.htm'><B>4121</B></A>).</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall prepare procedures for the recruitment and selection of all noncertificated staff.</P>
