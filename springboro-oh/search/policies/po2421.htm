<B><P>2421 - VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes that not all students wish to stay involved in formal education beyond high school and must, therefore, be prepared to enter the labor force as productive workers.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "vocational education" shall be defined as a program designed to provide educational experiences and guidance for students to plan and prepare for a future:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>in the labor market as employable individuals immediately after graduation with productive, salable skills;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>in education beyond high school with the opportunity to gain a marketable job skill(s) that will assist them in achieving career goals;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>in the world of work while continuing their education in order to help offset higher education expenses.</P>
<P>In addition to vocational classes required by law, the Board shall provide, in cooperation with the Warren County Career Center, a vocational education program which shall include:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>Industrial Education;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>Agricultural Education;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>Home Economics Education;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>Business Education.</P>
<P>The Board directs that any efforts to recruit students to participate in a particular vocational program must include literature and comparable recruitment efforts for disabled students in a format and context in which they can communicate.</P>
<P>The vocational education program may also include:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>a shared-time program outside of school;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>a work-study program involving the employment of qualified students.</P>
<P>The work-study programs are available to students without regard for race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. The Superintendent is to ensure that application forms for work-study programs contain a notice of nondiscrimination and that each employer associated with a work-study program has provided an assurance of nondiscrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, and disability prior to the time the students are selected and/or assigned.</P>
