<B><P>5408 - ACADEMIC ACCELERATION, EARLY ENTRANCE TO KINDERGARTEN, AND EARLY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION</P></B>
<P>In accordance with the belief that all children are entitled to an education commensurate with their particular needs, students who can exceed the grade-level indicators and benchmarks set forth in the standards must be afforded the opportunity and be encouraged to do so.</P>
<P>The Board of Education believes that such students often require access to advanced curriculum in order to realize their potential contribution to themselves and society.</P>
<P>All children learn and experience success given time and opportunity, but the degree to which academic content standards are met and the time it takes to reach the standards will vary from student to student.  The Board believes that all students, including advanced learners, should be challenged and supported to reach their full potential.  For many advanced learners, this can best be achieved by affording them access to curriculum, learning environments, and instructional interventions more commonly provided to older peers.</P>
<P>This policy describes the process that shall be used for evaluating students for possible accelerated placement and identifying students who should be granted early admission to kindergarten (see Policy <A HREF='po5112.htm'><B>5112</B></A>), accelerated in one or more individual subject areas, promoted to a higher grade level than their same age peers, and granted early graduation from high school.</P>

In all other cases, evaluations of a referred child shall be scheduled at the student's principal's discretion and placed in the accelerated setting(s) at the time recommended by the acceleration evaluation committee, if the committee determines the child should be accelerated.  Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 3321.01, all children who will be the proper age for entrance to kindergarten or first grade by the first day of January of the school year for which admission is requested shall be evaluated upon the request of the child's parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  Children who will not yet be the proper age for entrance to kindergarten or first grade by the first day of January of the school year for which admission is requested shall also be evaluated for possible early admittance if referred by an educator within the District, a pre-school educator who knows the child, or pediatrician or psychologist who knows the child (see Policy <A HREF='po5112.htm'><B>5112</B></A>).
