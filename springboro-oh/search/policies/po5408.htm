<P>In accordance with the belief that all children are entitled to an education commensurate with their particular needs, students who can exceed the grade-level indicators and benchmarks set forth in the standards must be afforded the opportunity and be encouraged to do so.</P>
<P>The Board of Education believes that such students often require access to advanced curriculum in order to realize their potential contribution to themselves and society.</P>
<P>All children learn and experience success given time and opportunity, but the degree to which academic content standards are met and the time it takes to reach the standards will vary from student to student.  The Board believes that all students, including advanced learners, should be challenged and supported to reach their full potential.  For many advanced learners, this can best be achieved by affording them access to curriculum, learning environments, and instructional interventions more commonly provided to older peers.</P>
<P>This policy describes the process that shall be used for evaluating students for possible accelerated placement and identifying students who should be granted early admission to kindergarten (see Policy <A HREF='po5112.htm'><B>5112</B></A>), accelerated in one or more individual subject areas, promoted to a higher grade level than their same age peers, and granted early graduation from high school.</P>
