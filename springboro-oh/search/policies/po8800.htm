<B><P>8800 - RELIGIOUS/PATRIOTIC CEREMONIES AND OBSERVANCES</P></B>
<P>Decisions of the United States Supreme Court have made it clear that it is not the province of a public school to advance or inhibit religious beliefs or practices.  Under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, this remains the inviolate province of the individual and the church of his/her choice.  The rights of any minority, no matter how small, must be protected.  No matter how well intended, either official or unofficial sponsorship of religiously-oriented activities by the school are offensive to some and tend to supplant activities which should be the exclusive province of individual religious groups, churches, private organizations, or the family.</P>
<P>District staff members shall not use prayer, religious readings, or religious symbols as a devotional exercise or in an act of worship or celebration.  The District shall not act as a disseminating agent for any person or outside agency for any religious or anti-religious document, book, or article.  Distribution of such materials on District property by any party shall be in accordance with Policy <A HREF='po7510.htm'><B>7510</B></A> - Use of District Facilities and Policy <A HREF='po9700.htm'><B>9700</B></A> - Relations with Special Interest Groups.</P>
<P>Observance of religious holidays through devotional exercises or acts of worship will not be authorized in instructional and District-sponsored activities.  Acknowledgement of, explanation of, and teaching about religious holidays of various religions is encouraged.  Celebration activities involving religious decorations and/or works are permitted, but it is the responsibility of all faculty members to ensure that such activities are strictly voluntary, do no place an atmosphere of social compulsion or ostracism on minority groups or individuals, and do not interfere with the regular school program.</P>
<P>The Board shall not conduct or sanction a baccalaureate service in conjunction with graduation ceremonies.</P>
<P>The Board shall not authorize religious invocations, benedictions, or formal prayer at any school-sponsored event.</P>
<P>The flag of the Unites States shall be raised above each school and/or at other appropriate places during all school sessions, weather permitting.  The flag shall be raised before the opening of school and taken down at its close every day.  Flag etiquette allows for twenty-four (24) hour illumination.</P>
<P>The Board requires that an observance be scheduled each year on or about Veterans Day.</P>
<P>Professional staff members are authorized to lead students in the Pledge of Allegiance at an appropriate time each school day.  However, no student shall be compelled to participate in the reciting of the Pledge.  The Superintendent shall ensure that any staff member who conducts this activity does it at an appropriate time, in an appropriate manner, and with due regard to the need to protect the rights and the privacy of a nonparticipating student.  Wording of the Pledge of Allegiance as set forth in the United States Code shall not be altered.</P>
