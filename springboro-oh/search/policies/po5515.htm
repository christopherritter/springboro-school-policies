<B><P>5515 - HUMAN DIGNITY</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizing that our students will work and live in a culturally diverse world believes it is part of our mission to provide a positive, harmonious environment in which the differences of individuals are recognized.  A major aim of education should be the development of core values of a democratic society.</P>
<P>In accordance with this aim, the School District will not tolerate behavior by students which insults, degrades, or stereotypes any race, gender, disability, physical condition, sexual orientation, marital status, ethnic group or religion.</P>
<P>Appropriate consequences for offending this policy will be specified in the student code of conduct of each school building and may include suspension or expulsion.</P>
<P>Adopted 3/28/01</P></BODY>
