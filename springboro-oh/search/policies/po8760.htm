<B><P>8760 - STUDENT ACCIDENT INSURANCE</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes that students may suffer injuries in the course of attendance at school and participation in the athletic and extracurricular programs of the schools.  Accordingly, the Board will provide such insurance coverage as is authorized by law and will make available to parents insurance coverage for other contingencies.</P>
<P>The Board will maintain insurance coverage by a qualified insurer at no cost to the student for injury resulting from accidents sustained in the course of transportation under the authority of the Board. </P>
<P>The Board will provide parents the opportunity to purchase group insurance coverage, at no cost to the Board, for injury resulting from accidents sustained by students in school, on school grounds, at an activity sponsored by the school, while traveling between home and school, and in any activity round-the-clock.</P>
<P>Participation shall be voluntary, and in no case shall insurance coverage be a requirement for participation in any school activity.</P>
<P>The Board requires that parents of students participating in interscholastic school athletics be required to acknowledge the life threatening nature of the activity and sign a statement to this effect.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall notify all parents of District students of the availability of group insurance from suitable and qualified insurance carriers.</P>
