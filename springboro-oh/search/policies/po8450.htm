<P>The Board of Education recognizes that control of the spread of communicable disease is essential to the well-being of the school community and to the efficient operation of the schools.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "communicable disease" shall include diphtheria, scarlet fever and other strep infections, whooping cough, mumps, typhoid fever, measles, rubella, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or any other designated by Federal authority.</P>
<P>In order to protect the health and safety of the students, school personnel, and the community at large, the Board shall follow all State statutes and Board of Health regulations which pertain to communicable disease.</P>
<P>On the recommendation of the school nurse, the principal may exclude from the classroom and the principal may exclude from the building or isolate in the school any student who appears to be ill or has been exposed to a communicable disease, except that the principal may act independently if the school nurse is not present in the building.</P>
