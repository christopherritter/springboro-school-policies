<P>Certificated staff as well as non-certificated staff may, within the scope of their employment, use and apply reasonable force and restraint to quell a disturbance which threatens to cause physical injury to others, to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects upon or within control of student, in self-defense, or for protection of persons or property.</P>
<P>It should be particularly noted that use of force must be "reasonable" and "necessary" when undertaken in a good-faith attempt to carry out the responsibilities of the employee's position.</P>
<P>When the employee inflicts unnecessary, unreasonable, irrational, or inappropriate force upon a student, s/he is subject to discipline by the Board.</P>
