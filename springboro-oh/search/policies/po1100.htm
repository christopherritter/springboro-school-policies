<B><P>1100 - DISTRICT ORGANIZATION</P></B>
<P>The organization of this District shall be designed to meet the objectives set by the Board of Education, ensure clean lines of authority, and defined each position with clarity.  Lines of direct authority will be those approved by the Board and shown on the District Organization Chart in Policy <A HREF='po1101.htm'><B>1101</B></A>.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall be the chief executive officer of the school district.  The Superintendent shall define and recommend those administrative positions required to implement the educational system and program of learning established by the Board.  In each case, the Board will approve the broad purpose of the position in harmony with state law and regulations.  The assignment of duties of each position is the responsibility of the Superintendent.</P>
<P>Responsibility and line of authority shall flow clearly from the Superintendent on through the administrative staff to all personnel.  Conversely, personnel will be expected to refer matters requiring administrative action to the administrator to whom they are responsible.  The administrator will refer such matters to the next higher administrative level when necessary.  Additionally, all personnel are expected to keep the person to whom they are immediately responsible informed of their activities by whatever means the person in charge deems appropriate.</P>
<P>Additionally, lines of authority do not restrict in any way the cooperative, sensible working together of all staff members at all levels in order to develop the best possible school programs and service.  The established lines of authority represent direction of authority and responsibility; when the staff is working together, the lines represent avenues for a two-way flow of ideas to improve the program and operations of the school system.</P>
<P>It shall be the responsibility of the Superintendent to determine the need for and define operational requirements sufficient to ensure the smooth functioning of the District.  Maintenance of an efficient, skilled operational staff is essential to the effective performance of the system.</P>
<P>It is the Board's intent to maintain an operational and technical staff with a high level of competence.</P>
<P>On occasion, the Superintendent may find it necessary to recommend to the Board the employment of specialists or consultants to maintain or support programs implemented by the District in areas requiring specialized knowledge.  These positions will be considered by the Board on the merits of their potential contribution to the School District and the specific conditions of the stated contract or agreement.</P>
