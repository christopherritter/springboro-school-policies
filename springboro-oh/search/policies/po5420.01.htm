<P>The Board of Education recognizes that students often undergo academic, social, emotional, and personal problems that may affect their school work or personal lives. Whenever teachers, parents, administrators, or other school personnel recognize a problem with a student that is affecting his/her performance, the following referral process will take place in order to assist that child:</P>

<P>The Board directs all school personnel to become familiar with this process and related procedures. Teachers shall begin the process by completing a "School Age Request for Assistance" (CI204) and meeting with the principal to identify problem areas and accommodation(s) attempted in the classroom. If further assistance is needed, the school principal shall coordinate an Intervention Assistance Team having representation from the teaching staff, guidance staff, and other professional support staff as appropriate. The Intervention Assistance Team shall be responsible for developing a set of classroom and/or home strategies to assist the student, &quot;Documentation of Interventions&quot; (CI207). Referral to community-based child assistance agencies may be made if deemed necessary.</P>
<P>If intervention strategies are deemed successful, the student shall be monitored to be sure s/he continues to progress. If intervention strategies are not successful, the team may request a multi-factored evaluation of the student. The team shall request such an evaluation by updating the &quot;School Age Request for Assistance&quot; form and forwarding the information to the school psychologist.</P>
