<B><P>8453.02 - HIV-POSITIVEAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)</P></B>
<P>For the purposes of this policy, the term HIV is synonymous with HIV Virus (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), and AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).</P>
<P>The Board of Education will work cooperatively with State and local health organizations to ensure compliance with the law.</P>
<P>Students identified with HIV are expected to be in compliance with the mandatory immunizations for school admittance.  Students who are HIV infected may be granted an exemption if immunizations would have a harmful effect on their health.  In such cases, the Superintendent of Schools and school nurses will work cooperatively with local and State health departments to approve exemption or exclusions.  Each student who is identified as HIV positive will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</P>
<P>The Superintendent will be the District contact person regarding all HIV incidences.  The Superintendent, upon learning that a student is infected, will consult with the student's family and, with written approval of the parent/guardian, will consult with the attending physician, local health department, and other agencies and school personnel deemed appropriate.  Since there is no known evidence that HIV is transmitted by casual contact, the student will remain in the regular classroom, unless this condition prohibits the student from progressing at a level consistent with his/her academic ability.</P>
<P>Parents/Guardians may appeal decisions that place restrictions or exclude a student.  The appeals process will include established procedures that include the following levels:  Superintendent, Board of Education.  In situations where a student is already receiving special education services, the appeal process would include:  administrative hearing, due process hearing with an impartial hearing officer, review by State Department of Education.</P>
<P>The District should provide in-service training to all school personnel, which should include:  local policies, transmission, prevention, and risk prevention of HIV; standard operating procedures for handling blood and body fluids; and community resources available for information and referral.</P>
<P>The Board directs the administration to develop an appropriate program for educating persons regarding HIV.  This program should make information about HIV available to students as part of the health curriculum.  Furthermore, the Board and the administration will assist other public agencies in providing information about HIV to the community.  In developing such programs, it is expected that information from sources such as The National Center for Disease Control, the Ohio Department of Health, and the Ohio Department of Education will be utilized.  One of the purposes of the education program will be to dispel fears based on erroneous information or lack of information.</P>
