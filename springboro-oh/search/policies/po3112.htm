However, since Board members are not authorized to act on behalf of the Board unless in open public session or when specifically vested with such authority, Board members and members of the staff should not discuss individual personalities, personnel grievances, or other complaints.  Instead, such matters should be addressed in accordance with the procedures established in Board Policy or the collective bargaining agreement.</P></FONT></<TD>
