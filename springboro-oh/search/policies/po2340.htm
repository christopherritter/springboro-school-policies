<P>The Board of Education recognizes that field trips when used for teaching and learning integral to the accomplishment of the District's educational goals are an educationally sound and important ingredient in the instructional program of the schools.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, a field trip is defined as any journey by a group of students away from the school premises, under the supervision of a teacher or authorized staff member, which is an integral part of the school program and conducted for the purpose of providing a first-hand educational experience not available in the classroom.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall approve all proposed field trips. The Board of Education shall be informed in advance of all out of State field trips.</P>
<P>Students on field trips and study trips approved by the Board remain under the supervision of the Board and are subject to its administrative guidelines.</P>
<P>Study trips to locations in Ohio, the U.S.A., or other countries which are not approved field trips must be approved in advance by the Board.  Such trips shall be voluntary for both the staff and students at no cost to the Board.  Student grades shall not be based in any way on participation in study trips.</P>
<P>No student may participate in an approved study trip without having on file in the principal's office a completed signed parent permission form and statement indemnifying the Board for damages or liability incurred during the study trip.</P>
<P>The Board does not assume liability in any way for any staff member of this District who takes students on trips not approved by the Superintendent.  No staff member may solicit students of this District for such trips on school premises without the permission of the building principal.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall prepare procedures for the operation of a field trip which ensure:</P>
