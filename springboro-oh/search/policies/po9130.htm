<B><P>9130 - PUBLIC COMPLAINTS </P></B>
<P>Any person or group having a legitimate interest in the schools of this District shall have the right to present a request, suggestion, or complaint concerning District personnel, the program, or the operations of the District.  At the same time, the Board of Education has a duty to protect its staff from unnecessary harassment.  It is the intent of this policy to provide the means for judging each public complaint in a fair and impartial manner and to seek a remedy where appropriate.  This procedure supplements those established in the collective bargaining agreements in effect.</P>
<P>It is the desire of the Board to rectify any misunderstandings between the public and the School District by direct discussions of an informal type among the interested parties.  It is only when such informal meetings fail to resolve the differences, shall more formal procedures be employed.</P>
<P>Any requests, suggestions, or complaints reaching the Board, Board members, and the administration shall be referred to the Superintendent for consideration according to the following procedure or according to approved collective bargaining agreements in effect.</P>
