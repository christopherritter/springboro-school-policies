<P>The purpose of this policy is to establish a historical comprehensive inventory system of items owned by the Board of Education with a value in excess of $500.00 and those items designated by the Treasurer to be subject to inventory.</P>
<P>The Board recognizes the appropriateness of a historical agency inventory policy insuring accurate accountability of the assets of the Board.</P>
<B><P>INVENTORIES</P></B>
<P>It is the purpose of these procedures to implement a comprehensive inventory system of all items owned by the Board with an original value greater than $500.00.</P>
<B><P>RESPONSIBILITY:</P></B>
<P>The responsibility for initial identification and tagging (item identification) lies with the Treasurer.</P>
<P>Responsibility for updating the location of inventory items and maintaining current information lies with each principal.</P>
<P>Responsibility for maintaining current information after principals have updated information lies with the Treasurer.</P>
<P>Overall responsibility for coordination and inventory system operation lies with the Treasurer.</P>
<B><P>INVENTORY SYSTEM (GENERAL):</P></B>
<P>The District will use the EIS (Equipment Inventory System) program available with the State approved software through SWOCA (Southwest Ohio Computer Association).  Information on inventory items (as defined above) consists of adding new items, updating location or other information and disposal of items.</P>
<P>The following procedures apply:</P>
<B><P>ADDING NEW ITEMS:</P></B>
<P>The EIS inventory program provides an opportunity to add purchased items while in INVOICE PROCESSING.  Donated items can be added directly into the program.  Prenumbered inventory tags to affix to inventoried items will be assigned and distributed from the office of the Treasurer.  These items will then appear on the inventory listings when printed.</P>
<B><P>UPDATING ITEM LOCATION:</P></B>
<P>Each year an updating of inventory items will be done.  A listing of all inventory items will be provided to each principal.  It is the principal's responsibility to:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>Confirm the correct location of all inventory items.</P>
B.</P><P>Update location information if the item has been moved from its location by writing on the sheets provided for the changed information.</P>
C.</P><P>Confirm that all appropriate items have been added to the inventory.</P>
D.</P><P>If an item has been moved to another building, indicate next to the item - "To Building ___________".  If an item has been moved <B>into</B> your building, simply write at the bottom of the inventory that the item is to be added to your building.</P>
E.</P><P>If an item has been removed for disposal from your building, simply write "disposed".  It will be taken care of as a disposed item through maintenance inventory.</P>
<P>When the principal completes the inventory, s/he should initial it and return it to the business office.  The changes will be updated and final listings returned to the principal.  S/He should review the changes, note any corrections, sign and return.  The inventory completed on 06-30- __ is the official inventory of the Board.  A complete listing will be maintained by the Treasurer.</P>
<B><P>DISPOSAL OT ITEMS:</P></B>
<P>Please refer to Board procedures for disposal of assets.</P>
<B><P>SPECIAL SITUATIONS:</P></B>
<P>During this inventory process, the following special situations may occur:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>If an item appears that is not in your school, review the item description, location, and other information; the wrong building number may have been entered.  If this is the case, note the change appropriately as an update.</P>
B.</P><P>If an item, in inventory, is not anywhere in your building or in the school system, it should be reported to the Superintendent, Treasurer or Director of Operations.  If circumstances warrant, a police report will be filed.</P>
