<P>The Board of Education recognizes that the regular school program may not be appropriate for all students and that certain students may need special programs to help them overcome attendance, academic, and/or behavioral problems.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the Superintendent to establish or to cooperate with other Districts in establishing an alternative school, in accordance with R.C. 3313.533, for grades 7-12.  The purpose of the alternative school will be to provide each student with a safe learning environment conducive to increased self-esteem, improved social skills, and higher academic achievement and/or a program to help students who have recently been discharged or released from the custody of the Department of Youth Services.  At the alternative school, students will be able to earn credits toward graduation in all academic subjects.</P>
<P>When considering a student for placement at the alternative school, at least one (1) of the following criteria must be met:</P>
