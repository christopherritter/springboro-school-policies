<P>The Board of Education believes that the primary duty of the Board is to establish policies and that the Superintendent shall administer such policies.  Policy should not be originated or changed without seeking the advice of the Superintendent.  The Superintendent shall have the latitude to determine the best method of implementing the policies of the Board.</P>
<P>The Superintendent, as the chief administrative officer of the School District, is the primary professional advisor to the Board.  S/He is responsible for the development, supervision, and operation of the school program and facilities.  His/her methods should be made known to the staff through the administrative procedures of the District.</P>
<P>The Board shall retain oversight supervision of such procedures.</P>
<P>The Board is responsible for determining the success of the Superintendent in meeting the goals established by the Board through annual evaluations of the Superintendent's performance.  The Board, in formulating its position with regard to the performance of the Superintendent, shall rely, whenever possible, on the objective outcomes of its evaluations rather than on subjective opinions.</P>
