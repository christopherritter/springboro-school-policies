<B><P>2416 - STUDENT PRIVACY AND PARENTAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education respects the privacy rights of parents and their children.  No student shall be required, as a part of the school program or the District's curriculum, without prior written consent of the student (if an adult, or an emancipated minor) or, if an unemancipated minor, his/her parents, to submit to or participate in any survey, analysis, or evaluation that reveals information concerning:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>political affiliations or beliefs of the student or his/her parents;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>mental or psychological problems of the student or his/her family;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>sex behavior or attitudes;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating or demeaning behavior;</P>
<P>E.</P><P>critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family relationships;</P>
<P>F.</P><P>legally recognized privileged and analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians, and ministers;</P>
<P>G.</P><P>religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or his/her parents; or</P>
<P>H.</P><P>income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such a program).</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall ensure that procedures are established whereby parents may inspect any materials used in conjunction with any such survey, analysis, or evaluation.</P>
<P>Further, parents have the right to inspect, upon request, a survey or evaluation created by a third party before the survey/evaluation is administered or distributed by the school to the student.  The parent will have access to the survey/evaluation within a reasonable period of time after the request is received by the building principal.</P>
<P>No survey or evaluation containing one or more of the items listed in A-H above will require student signatures.  The principal will inform parents of such a survey/evaluation or of a survey/evaluation created by a third party prior to disbursement by sending notification of such surveys/evaluations home with the students.  The parent may contact the principal if s/he wants to preview the survey/evaluation before hand, or deny participation by his/her child.</P>
<P>Additionally, parents have the right to inspect, upon request, any instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum of the student.  The parent will have access to the instructional material within a reasonable period of time after the request is received by the building principal.  The term instructional material means instructional content that is provided to a student, regardless of its format, including printed and representational materials, audio-visual materials, and materials in electronic or digital formats (such as materials accessible through the Internet).  The term does not include academic tests or assessments.</P>
<P>The Board will not allow the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students for the purpose of marketing or for selling that information (or otherwise providing that information to others for that purpose).</P>
<P>The Superintendent is directed to provide notice directly to parents of students enrolled in the District of the substantive content of this policy at least annually at the beginning of the school year, and within a reasonable period of time after any substantive change in this policy.  In addition, the Superintendent is directed to notify parents of students in the District, at least annually at the beginning of the school year, of the specific or approximate dates during the school year when the following activities are scheduled or expected to be scheduled:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>Activities involving the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students for the purpose of marketing or for selling that information (or otherwise providing that information to others for that purpose); and</P>
<P>B.</P><P>The administration of any survey by a third party that contains one or more of the items described in A through H above.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, the term "parent" includes a legal guardian or other person standing in loco parentis (such as a grandparent or stepparent with whom the child lives, or a person who is legally responsible for the welfare of the child).</P>
