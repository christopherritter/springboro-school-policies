<P>The Superintendent shall ensure that procedures are established whereby parents may inspect any materials used in conjunction with any such survey, analysis, or evaluation.</P>
<P>Further, parents have the right to inspect, upon request, a survey or evaluation created by a third party before the survey/evaluation is administered or distributed by the school to the student.  The parent will have access to the survey/evaluation within a reasonable period of time after the request is received by the building principal.</P>
<P>No survey or evaluation containing one or more of the items listed in A-H above will require student signatures.  The principal will inform parents of such a survey/evaluation or of a survey/evaluation created by a third party prior to disbursement by sending notification of such surveys/evaluations home with the students.  The parent may contact the principal if s/he wants to preview the survey/evaluation before hand, or deny participation by his/her child.</P>
<P>Additionally, parents have the right to inspect, upon request, any instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum of the student.  The parent will have access to the instructional material within a reasonable period of time after the request is received by the building principal.  The term instructional material means instructional content that is provided to a student, regardless of its format, including printed and representational materials, audio-visual materials, and materials in electronic or digital formats (such as materials accessible through the Internet).  The term does not include academic tests or assessments.</P>
<P>The Board will not allow the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from students for the purpose of marketing or for selling that information (or otherwise providing that information to others for that purpose).</P>
