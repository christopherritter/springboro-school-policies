<P>The Board of Education believes that radio or television coverage of school events can be beneficial to the District by focusing public attention on school events of interest to the community.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the Superintendent to approve media coverage of school events that does not interfere with such events as planned and presents factual, objective coverage thereof.</P>
<P>The Board reserves the right to negotiate for the radio broadcasting, televising, filming, or sound recording of any school event by an outside agency.</P>
<P>These rights, if sold, shall be contracted under conditions designed to bring the most favorable terms to the School District.</P>
<P>The Board, in the case of an interscholastic contest, may choose to share the fee with the opposing team, but it is not obligated to do so by the terms of this policy.</P>
