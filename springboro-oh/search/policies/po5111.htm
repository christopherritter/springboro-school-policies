<B><P>5111 - ELIGIBILITY OF RESIDENT/NONRESIDENT STUDENTS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education establishes the following residency policy for determining eligibility to attend the schools of this District.</P>
<P>The Board shall provide tuition-free education for the benefit of children at least five (5) but under twenty-two (22) years of age whose parents reside in the District and such others as may be eligible pursuant to Federal and/or State law and the policies of the Board, including disabled preschool children who are at least three (3) years of age but not of compulsory school age and who are not currently enrolled in kindergarten.</P>
As used in this policy, the term "parents" means either parent, unless the parents are separated or divorced, in which case the parent means the parent with legal custody of the child.  If neither parent has legal custody of the child, parent means person or government agency with legal custody or permanent custody, as defined by Ohio Revised Code.<BR>
<P>In addition, the Board shall provide tuition-free education for the benefit of a child whose grandparent(s) resides in the District and who is the subject of a:</P>
