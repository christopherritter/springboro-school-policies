<B><P>5430 - CLASS RANK</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education acknowledges the usefulness of a system of computing grade point averages and class ranking for high school graduates, both to inform students of their relative academic placement among their peers and to provide students, prospective employers, and institutions of higher learning with a predictive device so that each student is more likely to be placed in an environment conducive to success.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes a system of class ranking, by grade point average, for students in grade(s) 9-12.</P>
<P>All students shall be ranked together.</P>
<P>Any two (2) or more students whose computed grade point averages are identical shall be given the same rank. The rank of the student who immediately follows a tied position will be determined by the number of students preceding him/her and not by the rank of the person preceding him/her.</P>
<P>A student's grade point average and rank in class shall be entered on his/her record and shall be subject to the Board's policy on release of student records.</P>
<P>Rank in class shall be entered on students' records and on all transcripts where they will be available for review by authorized persons.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall develop procedures for the computation of grade point averages and the assignment of rank in class.</P>
