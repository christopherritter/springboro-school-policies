<B><P>2422 - HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education believes that a well-balanced development of sexual awareness and knowledge should be a part of the public school program.  This responsibility should be shared with the home and church.</P>
<P>The primary purpose of sex education instruction shall be to:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>help students understand moral and ethical value decisions that affect their sexuality;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>promote wholesome family and interpersonal relationships;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>help young people understand their sexuality;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>promote good personal health practices.</P>
<P>The Board believes that it is appropriate to teach sex education in coeducational classes.</P>
<P>Occasionally materials may be objectionable to some parents.  In this case, on the written request of the parent or guardian, the student may be excused from attending such instruction and an alternative activity may be provided.</P>
