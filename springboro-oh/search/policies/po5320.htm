<BODY><B><P>5320 - IMMUNIZATION</P></B>
<P>In order to safeguard the school community from the spread of certain communicable diseases and in recognition that prevention is a means of combating the spread of disease, the Board of Education requires all students to be immunized against poliomyelitis, measles, diphtheria, rubella (German measles), pertussis, tetanus, mumps, and others legally designated in accordance with State Statutes, unless specifically exempt for medical or other reasons. The Board requires that students who start kindergarten during or after the school year beginning in 1999 be immunized against Hepatitis B or be in the process of being immunized. The Board also requires that students who start kindergarten during or after the school year beginning in 2006 be immunized against chicken pox. This policy pertains to both students who currently attend school in the District and those eligible to attend.</P>
<P>The Superintendent and/or designee may exempt a student from being immunized against either or both measles and mumps if the student presents a signed statement from a parent or physician indicating s/he has had measles or mumps and does not need to be immunized. The student will be allowed to attend school only if a physician's statement indicates there is no danger of contagion. In case of an outbreak of the disease for which the student has not been immunized or an epidemic, the Superintendent and/or designee shall not allow the student to attend school.</P>
<P>In the case of a chicken pox epidemic in the school’s population, the Superintendent and/or designee may deny admission to a student otherwise exempted from the chicken pox immunization requirement. The Superintendent and/or designee shall prescribe methods whereby the academic standing of a student who is denied admission during a chicken pox epidemic is preserved.</P>
<P>The Superintendent and/or designee may also exempt a student from immunization if a physician certifies in writing that immunization from a particular disease is medically contra-indicated.</P>
<P>A student may also be exempted from immunization if a parent or guardian objects for good cause, including religious conviction.</P>
<P>A student who has not completed immunization may be admitted to school provided the necessary immunizations are being received in the fastest time consistent with the approved immunization schedule and good medical practice.</P>
<P>The Board believes that immunization is the primary responsibility of the parent(s).</P>
<P>Any immunization program conducted by this District requires prior approval of the Board and can only extend to those immunizations provided for by Statute and the rules of this Board.</P>
<P>Implementation of this policy shall be the administrative responsibility of the school nurse.</P>
