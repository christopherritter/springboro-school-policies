<P>It shall be the policy of the School Board to use regular or special-purpose school vehicles for transportation on field and other District-sponsored trips.</P>
<P>The transportation for all trips is to be by vehicles owned by the District and driven by approved drivers.  Expectations must have the approval of the Board.</P>
<P>Members of the staff or of the sponsoring organization shall be responsible for providing supervision on trips.  At least one (1) sponsor, chaperone, or staff member is expected to ride in each vehicle whenever students ride as well as to supervise students upon return to school and while they are waiting for rides home.</P>
<P>All students are expected to ride the school vehicle to and from each activity.  A special request must be made to the staff member or sponsor by the parent or in person to allow an exception.</P>
<P>No student is allowed to drive on any trip.  An exception may be made by the principal on an individual basis provided the student has parental permission in writing and does not transport any other student.</P>
<P>When a school sponsors an extra-curricular activity such as a recreational event, it will provide for the transportation.  The District will only assume responsibility for those students using the provided transportation.</P>
<P>Because of the potential liability, the District will not allow a student to participate in such an activity if transportation is not arranged for by the District.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall prepare administrative guidelines to ensure that all transportation is in compliance with Board policy on use of District vehicles or use of private vehicles as prescribed by Policy <A HREF='po8660.htm'><B>8660</B></A>.</P>
