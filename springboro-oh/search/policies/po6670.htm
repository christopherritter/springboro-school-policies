<P>The Public School Support Fund is intended to function like a small general fund applicable to each building and operating on a school fiscal year.</P>
<P>Receipts for the Public School Support Fund are anticipated from sale of goods and services including but not limited to pictures, vending machines, assemblies, food supplies, books, and carnivals.  Receipts may also be obtained through third party donations, dues, fees, and other charges.</P>
<P>Disbursements from the Public School Support Fund are anticipated from the need to disburse funds for the purchase of goods and services to support individual buildings' curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular programs including but not limited to purchased services, supplies, equipment, repairs and maintenance, contract services, and other objects in accordance with U.S.A.S. (Uniform School Accounting System).  Such disbursements must have a direct and obvious benefit to students.  Expenditures from the Public School Support Fund must be approved by the Superintendent.  The Treasurer must assure expenditures are allowable under this policy and USAS guidelines.</P>
