<P>The Board of Education shall not enter a contract knowingly with any supplier of goods or services to this District under which any Board member or officer, employee, or agent of this School District has any pecuniary or beneficial interest, direct or indirect, unless the person has not solicited the contract or participated in the negotiations leading up to the contract.  This prohibition shall not prevent any person from receiving royalties upon the sale of any educational material of which s/he is the author and which has been properly approved for use in the schools of this District.</P>
<P>Board members and school personnel shall not accept any form of compensation from vendors that might influence their recommendations on the eventual purchase of equipment, supplies, or services.  Furthermore, Board members and school personnel shall not accept any compensation from a vendor after a decision has been made to purchase equipment, supplies, or services from said vendor.  In addition, Board members or school personnel who recommend purchases, shall not enter into a contractual arrangement with a vendor seeking to do business with the District, or a vendor with whom the District is doing business, whereby an individual Board member or member of the school staff receives compensation in any form for services rendered.</P>
<P>Such compensation includes, but is not limited to, cash, checks, stocks, or any other form of securities, and gifts such as televisions, microwave ovens, computers, discount certificates, travel vouchers, tickets, passes, and other such things of value.  In the event that a Board member or member of the school staff receives such compensation, albeit unsolicited, from a vendor, the Board member or school staff member shall notify the Treasurer, in writing, that s/he received such compensation and shall thereafter promptly transmit said compensation to the Treasurer at his/her earliest opportunity.</P>
<P>Employee accrual of personal frequent-flyer miles, hotel &quot;bonus points&quot;, credit card &quot;rewards&quot;, or any other reward under such affinity programs (including credit points or rewards directed to non-profit organizations) or other merchant &quot;rewards&quot; programs as a result of a District purchase is strictly prohibited.</P>
<P>All sales persons, regardless of product, shall clear with the Superintendent's office before contacting any teachers, students, or other personnel of the School District.  Purchasing personnel shall not show any favoritism to any vendor.  Each order shall be placed in accordance with policies of the Board on the basis of quality, price, and delivery with past service a factor if all other considerations are equal.</P>
