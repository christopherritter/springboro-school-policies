<P>The Board of Education acknowledges that the Federal </FONT><I><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3>No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ("NCLBA")</I></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2> provides that the parents/guardians of students enrolled in a Title I school that has been listed for "School Improvement" for two (2) or more years, have the right to transfer their children to another school in the District, provided there is a school that provides instruction at the students’ grade level(s) and such school has not been identified as being in the process of school improvement, corrective action, or restructing.  If there is not another school in the District offering instruction at the students’ grade level(s) that has not been identified as needing improvement, the Superintendent shall contact neighboring districts and request that they permit students to transfer to a school in one of those districts.  The Superintendent shall also offer Supplemental Educational Services (SES) if a transfer within the District is not possible.</P>
<P>Additionally, students attending a "persistently dangerous" school, as defined by State law have the right to transfer to another "safe" school in the District.  If there is not another &quot;safe&quot; school in the District providing instruction at the students’ grade level(s), the Superintendent shall contact neighboring districts and request that they permit students to transfer to a school in one of those districts.</P>
<P>Furthermore, a student who is a victim of a &quot;violent crime&quot; on school property also has the right to transfer to another school.  If there is not another school in the District providing instruction at the student’s grade level, the Superintendent shall contact neighboring districts and request that they permit that student to transfer to a school in one of those districts providing instruction at the student’s grade level.</P>
<P>Children who transfer in accordance with this policy will be permitted to remain at the school of transfer until completing the highest grade at the school.</P>
