<P>The Board of Education directs the establishment of an account to be known as the Textbook and Instructional Materials Account to provide sufficient instructional materials to ensure a thorough and efficient education for all District students.  The monies are to be used strictly for textbooks and instructional software, materials, supplies, and equipment.</P>
<P>The Treasurer shall be responsible for the administration of the Account and shall arrange to deposit into the Account each year the percentage, designated by the State, of revenues received for operating expenses.</P>
<P>During any given fiscal year, monies may be appropriated for other purposes than those listed above if the Board so resolves by unanimous vote of all members after receiving written certification from the Superintendent and the president of the Springboro Education Association that the District has sufficient textbooks and instructional software, materials, supplies, and equipment to ensure a thorough and efficient education within the District.</P>
<P>This requirement is not to be superseded by any terms of a collectively-bargained, negotiated agreement.</P>
