<B><P>5722 - SCHOOL SPONSORED PUBLICATIONS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education may sponsor student publications as a means for students to learn, under adult direction, the rights and responsibilities of the press in a free society.</P>
<P>Such publications also play a vital role in the school program by:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>interpreting students and the school to the community;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>serving as a public relations media;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>developing skills in communicating via the mass media;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>developing acceptable methods for preserving the constitutional provision of free speech.</P>
<P>In sponsoring a student publication, the Board is mindful of the fact that the publication could be available to any student attending this school, and must, therefore, be generally suitable for all students.</P>
<P>Issues on which opposing points of view have been promulgated by responsible opinion may be introduced in a school sponsored publication provided both sides of the issue are given equal opportunity to present their views and provided further that the material is generally acceptable to this community.</P>
<P>Materials which violate or may violate the rights of others may not be published. A listing of such material is given in the Board's policy for "Student Sponsored Publications."</P>
<P>The decision on publication shall be made by the advisor with appeal to the principal and Superintendent.</P>
