<P>In sponsoring a student publication, the Board is mindful of the fact that the publication could be available to any student attending this school, and must, therefore, be generally suitable for all students.</P>
<P>Issues on which opposing points of view have been promulgated by responsible opinion may be introduced in a school sponsored publication provided both sides of the issue are given equal opportunity to present their views and provided further that the material is generally acceptable to this community.</P>
<P>Materials which violate or may violate the rights of others may not be published.  A listing of such material is given in the Board's policy for "Student Sponsored Publications."</P>
<P>The decision on publication shall be made by the advisor with appeal to the principal and Superintendent.</P>
