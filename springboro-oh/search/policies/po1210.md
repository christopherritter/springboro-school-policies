1210 - BOARD - SUPERINTENDENT RELATIONSHIP

The Board of Education believes that the primary duty of the Board is to
establish policies and that the Superintendent shall administer such
policies. Policy should not be originated or changed without seeking the
advice of the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall have the latitude
to determine the best method of implementing the policies of the Board.

The Superintendent, as the chief administrative officer of the School
District, is the primary professional advisor to the Board. S/He is
responsible for the development, supervision, and operation of the
school program and facilities. His/her methods should be made known to
the staff through the administrative procedures of the District.

The Board shall retain oversight supervision of such procedures.

The Board is responsible for determining the success of the
Superintendent in meeting the goals established by the Board through
annual evaluations of the Superintendent's performance. The Board, in
formulating its position with regard to the performance of the
Superintendent, shall rely, whenever possible, on the objective outcomes
of its evaluations rather than on subjective opinions.
