<P>The Board of Education is committed to the effective use of technology to both enhance the quality of student learning and the efficiency of Board operations.  It also recognizes that safeguards have to be established to ensure that the Board's investment in both hardware and software is achieving the benefits of technology and inhibiting negative side effects.  As such, the Board directs that students are educated about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response.</P>
<P>The Superintendent is directed to establish administrative guidelines not only for proper acquisition of technology but also to provide guidance to staff and students concerning making appropriate and ethical use of the Board's computers and other technological equipment.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall further establish appropriate procedures to inform both staff and students about disciplinary actions that will be taken if Board technology and/or networks are abused in any way or used in an illegal or unethical manner.</P>
<P>Adopted 3/22/11</P></FONT></BODY>
