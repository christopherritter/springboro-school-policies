<B><P>2111 - PARENT AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes and values parents and families as the children's initial teachers and decision-makers in education.  The Board believes that student learning is more likely to occur when there is an effective partnership between the school and the student's parents and family.  Such a partnership between the home and school and greater involvement of parents in the education of their children generally result in higher academic achievement, improved student behavior, and reduced absenteeism.</P>
<P>In accordance with statute and the State Board of Education Parent and Family Involvement Policy, use of the term "families" is used in order to include children's primary caregivers, who are not their biological parents, such as foster caregivers, grandparents, and other family members.</P>
<P>In cultivating partnerships with families and communities, the Board is committed to the following:</P>

<B><P>Implementation</P></B><P>The Superintendent will provide for a comprehensive plan to engage parents, families, and community members in a partnership in support of each student's academic achievement, the District's continuous improvement, and individual school improvement plans.  The plan will provide for annual evaluation, with the involvement of parents and families, of the plan's effectiveness and identification of barriers to participation by parents and families.  Evaluation findings will be used in the annual review of the Parent and Family Involvement policy and to improve the effectiveness of the District plan.</P>
