<P>A child is eligible for entrance into kindergarten if s/he attains the age of five (5) on or before the thirtieth (30th) day of September of the year in which s/he applies for entrance.</P>
<P>The Board may admit to kindergarten such children as may be ineligible by reason of age but demonstrate the ability and need to undertake an accelerated program of education.  The child shall have attained the age of five (5) by the first (1st) day of January of the kindergarten school year in which s/he is enrolled.  Children who will not be the proper age for entrance to kindergarten by the first day of January of the school year for which admission is requested shall also be evaluated for early admittance if referred by an educator within the District, a pre-school educator who knows the child, or a pediatrician or psychologist who knows the child.  Such children may also be evaluated at the discretion of the principal of the school to which the student may be admitted.</P>
<P>Before a student is evaluated for early entrance, the principal (or his/her designee) of the school to which the child may be admitted shall obtain written permission from the child’s parent/guardian.</P>
<P>When a parent or guardian requests early entrance to kindergarten, information for testing by a District psychologist will be provided.  Such request should be made to the District Director of Instruction or the principal of the building of attendance for such child.</P>
