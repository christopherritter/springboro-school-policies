<B><P>5420 - REPORTING STUDENT PROGRESS</P></B>
<B><P>Purpose Statement</P></B>
<P>The Springboro Community City School District recognizes the importance of cooperation between the home and school, and its responsibility in keeping parents informed of the progress of students in school.  Student grading and progress reporting procedures are intended to reflect student competency in the mastery of learning objectives, student growth over the course of a school year (including citizenship and effort), and student achievement - what the student knows or can do.</P>
<P>Grading and progress reporting procedures shall provide guidance to teachers in evaluating student competency, growth, and achievement.  Grading and reporting procedures shall also allow for flexibility in providing for individual needs and differences of students.  Evaluation in terms of competency (mastery) and achievement shall not ignore individual differences among students nor shall evaluation in terms of effort mean that high standards have been ignored.  Teachers are encouraged to emphasize competency and achievement in grading, but with the individual student in mind.  Grading and reporting procedures shall apply to all learning situations within the school setting.</P>
<P>Grading and reporting procedures shall provide a regular and frequent source of information about the competence, growth, and achievement of students for parents, students, and others with an interest in the student's educational status.  Grading and reporting procedures for each class shall be explained to parents either through direct parent contact or be sent home to parents.  Grading procedures shall be based upon the assumption that students will respond to clear and accurate reporting of competence, growth, and achievement as positive opportunities for success rather than threats of failure.  Criteria used to measure competence, growth, and achievement shall be designed to be as objective as possible and appropriate to the age and maturity of students.  Criteria for grading shall be consistently reported, based upon valid educational practice, and based upon an appropriate number of demonstrated instances of student performance.</P>
<B><P>Reporting Student Progress</P></B><P>Student competency, growth and achievement will be reported in four nine-week  or quarter grading periods for grades K – 12.  A grade report will be sent to parents at the end of each grading period.  All students should receive an appropriate amount of information about competence, growth and achievement from the results of work that has been reviewed and evaluated in the professional judgment of the teacher (i.e., Homework, in-class work, assessments, participation, and effort).  Parents should be consulted if, in the teacher's judgment, the child's academic situation warrants parental contact.  For grades K – 12, teachers shall use professional judgment to record an adequate number of instances of student performance as the basis of assigning grades.  A minimum of nine (9) grades must be taken for each core academic subject as the basis of the nine-week/quarter grade.  The following shall serve as the basis of assigned grades in the Springboro Community City Schools:</P><TR><TD WIDTH="11%" VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</P>

<P>Communications with parents about a student's conduct and citizenship is important.  Although the Grading Policy Committee recommends that a conduct grade not be reported on the report card, comments will be added to the report card for discipline/conduct for selection by the teacher.  The individual buildings may develop other methods of reporting citizenship and conduct to parents.</P>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN=2>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Although citizenship will not be reported as a grade on report cards, student behavior can affect grades due to unexcused absence, suspension, or expulsion.  As stated in Board Policy, "When a student is suspended or expelled from school, the days will be classified as unexcused absences.  Therefore, the student will not be able to make up work missed during the period of suspension or expulsion.  In the case of suspension, however, the principal may use discretion to allow the make-up of semester/final exams and long term assignments (but is not limited to these), providing the student requests such make-up work and that the request is made within twenty-four (24) hours of the effective date of the suspension."  This may affect the student's grade for those classes.</P>
