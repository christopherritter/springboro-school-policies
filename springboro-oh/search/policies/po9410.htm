<P>Representatives of the local press, radio, and TV are an important link in the communications chain between school and community.  The maintenance of good working relationships with these persons is essential to meeting those objectives of the school-community relations program which require the support and cooperation of the media representatives.</P>
<P>The Board of Education authorizes the development of a sound working relationship between the news media and the District, based on mutual respect and cooperation.</P>
