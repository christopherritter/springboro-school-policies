The maintenance of good working relationships with these persons is essential to meeting those objectives of the school-community relations program which require the support and cooperation of the media representatives.</P>
<P>The Board of Education authorizes the development of a sound working relationship between the news media and the District, based on mutual respect and cooperation.</P>
