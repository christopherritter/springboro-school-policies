<P>Furthermore, the Superintendent shall inform all volunteers who work or apply to work unsupervised with children on a regular basis of the need to display appropriate behavior at all times, and that they may be required to provide a set of fingerprints at any time so that a criminal records check can be conducted. If a criminal records check is then conducted, it will be done as a condition of continued service as a volunteer and will be at the Board's expense.</P>
<P>If a criminal records check indicates that a volunteer has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any of the offenses described in R.C. 109.572(A)(1), the volunteer will be informed either that the Board is no longer interested in maintaining their volunteer service or that the volunteer will be assigned to duties for which s/he will not work unsupervised with children.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall inform each volunteer of the District's appreciation for his/her time and efforts in assisting in the operation of the schools and for his/her understanding with regard to the need for all volunteers to be subject to possible criminal records check.</P>
