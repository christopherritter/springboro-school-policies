<P>The Board reserves the right to place a certificated staff member on unrequested leave of absence or retire a certificated staff member for physical or mental disability to perform assigned duties.</P>
<P>In the case of a certificated staff member who, in the opinion of the Superintendent, is unable to function properly in this District by reason of physical or mental dysfunction, the certificated staff member will be offered the opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with law governing termination hearings.  In cases where the health of students or employees may be jeopardized, the Superintendent may at any time place the employee on paid leave until the risk is substantiated or disproved.</P>
<P>If a certificated staff member fails to comply with the Superintendent's recommendation or fails to request an appearance before the Board within the time allowed, the Board shall order the certificated staff member to submit to an appropriate examination by:</P>

<P>Where the physician designated by the Board disagrees with the physician designated by the certificated staff member, the two (2) physicians shall agree in good faith on a third impartial physician who shall examine the employee and whose medical opinion shall be conclusive and binding on the issue of medical capacity to perform the essential functions.  The expenses of a third examination shall be borne by the Board.</P>
<P>If, as a result of such examination, the certificated staff member is found to be unable to perform essential functions, the certificated staff member shall be placed on leave of absence until proof of recovery, satisfactory to the Superintendent, is furnished.</P>
<P>Should a certificated staff member refuse to submit to the examination requested by the Board and the certificated staff member has exercised his/her rights under the provisions hereinabove set forth, such refusal shall subject the certificated staff member to disciplinary action that may include procedures for termination of a contract.</P>
