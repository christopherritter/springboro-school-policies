<B><P>4121 - CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECK</P></B>
<P>In accordance with State law, the Board of Education requires a criminal background check including information from the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCII) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of each applicant the Superintendent recommends for employment on the District's non-teaching staff as well as for all current non-teaching employees on a periodic basis.  These requirements apply to any non-teaching employee, including individuals employed by a private company under contract with the Board to provide essential school services in accordance with Policy 8142, and all substitutes and persons employed on a part-time basis such as coaches or activity supervisors.</P>
<P>Special rules relating to employees engaged in the operation of a vehicle for student transportation (bus/van drivers) and non-teaching employees who are also licensed by the Ohio Department of Education (e.g. aides with a permit, paraprofessionals with a license, and those individuals who do not hold a valid educator's license but who are employed by the Board under a student activity permit), are set forth below.</P>
<P>A criminal background check is not required of any currently-employed staff member who is a candidate for another position in the District, unless otherwise required by law and/or this policy.</P>
<B><P>Non-Teaching Employees Not Engaged in the Operation of a Vehicle for Student Transportation (Bus/Van Driver)</P></B>
<P>The Superintendent shall establish administrative guidelines which will require an appropriate records check that complies with the law.  These guidelines shall require a criminal history records check, which will include criminal history information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), at the time of an initial application and every five (5) years thereafter on or before September 5th of the fifth year, for current non-teaching employees every five (5) years on or before September 5th of the fifth year, and for any individual employed by a private company under contract with the Board to provide essential school services as set forth in Policy 8142.</P>
<P>The guidelines shall also require that any information and records obtained from such inquiries be kept confidential and shall not be released or disseminated.</P>
<P>Should it be necessary to employ a person to maintain continuity of the District's operations, prior to receipt of the criminal history record, the Superintendent may, except in the case of a bus driver, employ the person on a provisional basis until the report is received.</P>
<B><P>Student Transportation Employees</P></B>
<P>The administrator in charge of transportation shall obtain a satisfactory BCII report prior to hiring an individual as a new school bus or school van driver, along with an FBI background check (i.e., an FBI background check will also be required prior to hiring new employees).  An updated, satisfactory BCII report shall be obtained for each school bus driver every six (6) years with driver re-certification.  "Satisfactory" shall be defined by the same standards applied to other public school employees.  Such records shall be maintained for a minimum of six (6) years.</P>
<P>In addition to the required BCII check, a copy of each new school bus driver's complete driving record must be obtained from the Ohio Department of Education prior to allowing the school bus driver to operate a school bus or school van for the first time.  In accordance with State transportation regulations, the Superintendent shall request the administrator in charge of transportation to conduct at least a semi-annual review of each school bus driver’s (i.e., current bus drivers and those newly hired bus drivers who remain employed with the Board) driving record through the Ohio Department of Education to determine that such drivers have:</P>

<P>The records obtained from the semi-annual records check will also be maintained for a minimum of six (6) years.</P>
<P>If a school bus driver has any of the above-referenced violations, s/he will be disqualified from operating a school bus.  The bus driver will also be notified that his/her school bus certification will be reviewed by the Superintendent and his/her employment as a school bus driver may be terminated.</P>
<P>If a school bus driver has an interruption in driving a school bus or school van for a period of one (1) year or longer, s/he will not be permitted to resume operating a school bus or school van until a copy of the school bus driver's complete driving record has been obtained.</P>
<P>No driver who is convicted of a traffic violation or has his/her commercial driver's license (CDL) suspended will be permitted to operate a school bus or school van until the driver files a written notice of the conviction or suspension.  Such written notice must be immediately filed with the Superintendent or administrator in charge of transportation, irrespective of whether the traffic violation occurred while operating a Board-owned vehicle or a private vehicle or during school or non-school hours.  Failure to file the required written notice of conviction or suspension will result in the revocation of the driver's certificate and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</P>
<P>Further, no bus driver will be permitted to drive a school bus or school van unless s/he meets all other requirements contained in the rules adopted by the Ohio Department of Education prescribing qualifications of drivers of school buses and other student transportation.  In addition, no bus driver will be permitted to drive a school bus or school van unless:</P>

  <TR>
    <TD WIDTH='25'>&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH='25' ALIGN='left' VALIGN='top'>A.</TD><TD>information pertaining to the bus driver has been submitted to the Ohio Department of Education, including the name of the Board, name of the bus driver, driver license number, date of birth, date of hire, status of physical evaluation and status of training; and</P></<TD>

  </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>Similar to other applicants, a satisfactory BCII report and FBI background check are required prior to the hiring of an individual as a school bus aide for pre-school and special needs children.  In addition, the administrator in charge of transportation will obtain updated, satisfactory criminal records reports for each school bus aide every six (6) years.  Satisfactory shall be defined by the same standards applied to other non-certified public school employees.  Such records shall also be maintained for a minimum of six (6) years.</P>
<B><P>Current Non-Teaching Employees Also Licensed by the Ohio Department of Education</P></B>
<P>Consistent with Policy <A HREF='po8141.htm'><B>8141</B></A> and State law, certain non-teaching employees who are also licensed by the Ohio Department of Education (e.g., aides with a permit, paraprofessionals with a license, and those individuals who do not hold a valid educator's license but who are employed by the Board under a student activity permit) shall be required to undergo a criminal record check as described in this policy, upon renewal of any license, certificate or permit.</P>
<P>For these non-teaching employees, the Ohio Department of Education may waive the requirements of a criminal background check for those non-teaching employees who are also licensed by the State Department seeking the issuance or renewal of a license, certificate of permit, who have undertaken such process within the immediately preceding year.</P>
<B><P>Effect of Guilty Plea and/or Conviction of Enumerated Crimes – All Non-Teaching Employees</P></B>
<P>Non-teaching employees who are also licensed by the Ohio Department of Education (e.g., aides with a permit, paraprofessionals with a license, and those individuals who do not hold a valid educator's license but who are employed by the Board under a student activity permit) who engage in conduct unbecoming the teaching profession and/or who it is determined have pled guilty to or have been convicted of any offense enumerated under R.C. 3319.39(B)(1) including a judicial finding for intervention in lieu of conviction and/or participation in a pre-trial diversion program relating to any of the offenses listed therein, are subject to the mandatory reporting requirements set forth in Policy <A HREF='po8141.htm'><B>8141</B></A>, in addition to an action by the Board to terminate their employment. In addition, consistent with State law and Policy <A HREF='po4138.htm'><B>4138</B></A>, the Superintendent shall immediately suspend such licensed non-teaching employees from all duties that require the care, custody, or control of a child during any pending criminal action for which that licensed, non-teaching staff member has been arrested, summoned and/or indicted for any crimes set forth in R.C. 3319.31(C).</P>
<P>All other non-teaching employees who are the subject of a criminal records check including applicants hired provisionally in advance of a completed criminal records check, as well as student transportation employees (bus/van drivers, preschool and special needs bus aides), and/or individuals employed by a private company under contract with the Board to provide essential school services in accordance with Policy 8142, who it is determined have pled guilty to or been convicted of any offense enumerated under R.C. 3319.39(B)(1) including a judicial finding for intervention in lieu of conviction and/or participation in a pre-trial diversion program relating to any of the offenses listed therein, shall not be hired or shall be released from employment, as applicable, unless such individual meets the rehabilitation standards adopted by the Ohio Department of Education under division (E) of that section at the time of the hiring and/or upon discovery of such plea or conviction by the Board.</P>
<P>In the case of employees hired by the Board to operate a vehicle used for student transportation (i.e., bus/van drivers), a guilty plea or conviction of a crime to any offense listed in R.C. 3319.31(C) will serve as a bar to further employment with the Board and the rehabilitation standards will not apply.</P>
<B><P>Suspension From Duties Involving Care, Custody or Control of a Child for Arrest, Summons and/or Indictment for Certain Crimes</P></B>
<P>In accordance with State law and Policy <A HREF='po4138.htm'><B>4138</B></A>, the Superintendent (or Treasurer in the case of an employee whose duties are assigned by the Treasurer) shall immediately suspend any non-licensed, non-teaching employee from all duties that require the care, custody, or control of a child during any pending criminal action for which that staff member has been arrested, summoned and/or indicted for any crimes listed under R.C.&nbsp;3319.39(B)(1).</P>
