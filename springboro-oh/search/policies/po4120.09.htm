<P>Furthermore, the Superintendent shall inform all volunteers who work or apply to work unsupervised with children on a regular basis of the need to display appropriate behavior at all times, and that they will have to provide a set of fingerprints so that a criminal records check can be conducted and that they will have to pay the costs associated with the criminal records check either before they begin their duties, or as a condition of continued service as a volunteer at the discretion of the Board.</P>
<P>If a criminal records check indicates that a volunteer has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any of the offenses listed below and/or described in R.C.&nbsp;109.572&nbsp;(A)(1), the volunteer will be informed either that the Board is no longer interested in maintaining his/her volunteer service or that the volunteer will be assigned to duties for which s/he will not work unsupervised with children.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall inform each volunteer of the District's appreciation for his/her time and efforts in assisting in the operation of the schools and for his/her understanding with regard to the need for all volunteers to be subject to possible criminal records check.</P>
