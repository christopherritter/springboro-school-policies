<P>It is the policy of the Board of Education that student groups be recognized as authorized school organizations only if they are approved by the school administration, sponsored by school-approved personnel, composed of members of the current student body, hold the majority of their meetings at school, and have established aims which are educational in nature.</P>
<P>Membership or participation in the organization or operation of any fraternity, sorority, or other secret group as described by law is prohibited throughout the School District.  In particular, the Board shall not tolerate any type of gang or gang-related activity to occur on District property or while students are under the auspices of the Board.</P>
