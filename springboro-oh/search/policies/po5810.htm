<P>Students also will be encouraged to assist in the formulation of policy for the school system.</P>
<P>In the development of administrative guidelines and arrangements for the operation of the school system, the Superintendent shall include at the planning stage, whenever feasible and appropriate, representatives of those students who will be affected by such provisions.</P>
<P>The Superintendent will establish procedures by which students can readily communicate their ideas and opinions regarding the operation of the school system.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the establishment of class and school governmental organizations, including student associations or councils, in keeping with the students' level of maturity, to offer practice in self-government, and to serve as channels for the expression of student opinion.</P>
