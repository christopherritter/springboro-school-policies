<B><P>3120.08 - EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONNEL FOR CO-CURRICULAR/EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education may employ professional staff for co-curricular/extra-curricular activities.  However, the Board may find it necessary to employ, on a part-time basis, coaches or activity sponsors who are not members of the professional staff.  Such part-time employees may be members of the District's classified staff or individuals from the community or nearby areas.  The Board authorizes the Superintendent to recommend candidates for employment by the Board.</P>
<P>Each coach or activity sponsor shall hold a valid Pupil Activity Program Permit issued by the State Board of Education under R.C. 3319.303(A), have any other necessary qualifications, have been properly interviewed, and shall sign an employment contract which includes the conditions of employment, compensation arrangements, and contract termination procedures.</P>
<P>Personnel employed as a coach or activity sponsor must also pass a background check performed by the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (see Policy <A HREF='po3121.htm'><B>3121</B></A>).</P>
<P>The Board may renew the contract of any nonlicensed individual, currently employed by the Board for one or more years, without first offering the position held by that individual to employees of the District who are licensed individuals or advertising the position as available to any qualified licensed individuals who are not currently employed by the Board unless otherwise prohibited by a collective bargaining agreement.</P>
<P>No individual employed by the Board for any co-curricular or extra-curricular activity may accept compensation from any third party or source, including, but not limited to booster, parent or other District support organizations, for the performance of his/her official duties or as a supplement to his/her compensation from the Board.</P>
<P>No individual serving as a volunteer for co-curricular/extra-curricular activities may accept compensation from any third party or source, including, but not limited to booster, parent or other District support organizations, for the performance of his/her official duties as a volunteer on behalf of the Board.</P>
