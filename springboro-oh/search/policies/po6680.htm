<P>The Board of Education wishes to honor contributions of its staff, former Board members, other non-employee persons, students, citizens, and advisory groups with plaques, pins, token retirement gifts and awards, with appropriate recognitions and authorizes administrators to purchase meals, refreshments, and other amenities.</P>
<P>The Board affirms that the expenses incurred as listed above do serve a valid and proper public purpose.  However, under no circumstances will public funds be expended for the purchase of alcoholic beverages.  The Board believes that the &quot;public purpose&quot; served is the promotion of education, rapport with the business community, community relations, and the encouragement of non-employees to serve as volunteers.  The funds shall be those available from interest earned from the Board's General Fund investment program.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the establishment of appropriation code(s) for promotion purposes in an amount(s) determined annually by the Board.</P>
<P>The Superintendent is authorized to approve all expenditures from this appropriation account.</P>
