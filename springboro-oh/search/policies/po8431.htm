<P>The Board of Education is concerned for the safety of the students and staff members and will attempt to comply with all Federal and State statutes and regulations to protect them from hazards that may result from industrial accidents beyond the control of school officials or from the presence of asbestos materials used in previous construction.</P>

<P>The Superintendent shall appoint an employee to serve as Toxic Hazard Preparedness (THP) Officer. The THP Officer is responsible for:</P><P>A.</P><P>identifying potential sources of toxic hazard in cooperation with material suppliers who shall supply the THP Officer with Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's);</P>

<P>In fulfilling these responsibilities, the THP Officer may enlist the aid of county and municipal authorities and, if possible, the owners or operators of identified potential sources of toxic hazard.</P>
<P>The Board may, in its discretion, appoint and charge an ad hoc committee of community representatives to assist the THP Officer.</P>

<P>Any staff member or contractor who applies pesticides on District property shall meet the requirements of AG 8431A in addition to the requirements established by law.</P>

<P>the type of pesticide and its potential side effects;</P>
<P>C.</P>
<P>the location of the application; and</P>
<P>D.</P>
<P>the date of the application.</P>
<P>The method and type of prior notifications and signage shall be determined by the District (AG 8431A).</P>
<P>If circumstances arise that prevent prior notification from being provided, regarding such emergency application of pesticides to control organisms that pose an immediate health threat, the District shall provide notice as soon as possible. In addition to the information specified above, the notice shall provide the reasons why advance notice was not provided.</P>
