<B><P>9270 - HOME EDUCATION</P></B>
The Board of Education requires that all resident students of compulsory schooling age attend a chartered public or nonpublic school as required by the Ohio Revised Code.  If a parent desires an exception in order to provide home instruction for a resident student of compulsory age, the parent must comply with the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and the related administrative guidelines promulgated by the Ohio Department of Education.  These requirements must be met annually prior to a student’s participation in home education.<BR>
<P>The Board shall not allow a student who attends a nondistrict school to participate in any of the District's co-curricular or extra-curricular activities.  The Board shall allow a student who has been excused from attendance for home education to participate in any of the District’s co-curricular or extra-curricular activities, provided that the following standards have been met:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>The student must be enrolled for two (2) periods per day in two (2) year-long courses or the equivalent semester/quarter courses.</P>
B.</P><P>Enrollment must be continuous throughout the school year.  Failure to fulfill this requirement will jeopardize future participation in extra or co-curricular activities.</P>
C.</P><P>The student must meet and document all the eligibility requirements of the Springboro Community School District and the OHSAA throughout the school year to maintain eligibility.  For additional information, contact the Springboro Community School District Athletic Director.</P>
D.</P><P>The student must have been home-educated for an entire school year prior to being granted eligibility and have met and can document the achievement of the minimum credit and GPA requirements of the Springboro Community School District and OHSAA.</P>
<P>Although students choosing home education are not the direct responsibility of the Springboro Community Schools, the Board and staff share an interest in their education.  Therefore, the Springboro Community School District will permit students receiving home education access to the following services from the District:</P>
<P>A.</P><P><B>Elementary&nbsp;Level,&nbsp;Grades&nbsp;K-5<BR></<P>
<P></B>Enrollment for the entire school year, up to a maximum of two (2) special subject areas of art, music, and physical education.</P>
B.</P><P><B>Secondary&nbsp;Level,&nbsp;Grades&nbsp;6-12</B><BR></<P>
<P>Enrollment for the entire school year, up to a maximum of two (2) year-long courses or semester/quarter equivalent courses for no more than two (2) periods per day.</P>
<P>Enrollment procedures for home educated students are as follows:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>Requests for enrollment must be made by a parent/guardian and submitted to the Superintendent, or Superintendent’s designee, at the time of notification of home education prior to the intended school year of enrollment.  Proof of residency must accompany the request.</P>
B.</P><P>Students enrolling must be residents of the District and follow regular school enrollment requirements and will be assigned on a space available basis.  Upon excusal from attendance of the Superintendent, home educated students who transfer into the District during the school year may enroll in special subjects or academic courses as permitted in this policy.</P>
C.</P><P>Students enrolling must comply with and will be held accountable to the District student Code of Conduct.</P>
D.</P><P>Students enrolling are expected to complete all course work normally required and will be graded similarly for the courses or subjects enrolled.</P>
E.</P><P>A student’s grade point average will be established for award and class rank purposes only after the student has enrolled full-time and attended school full-time in the District for three (3) consecutive semesters.  Home educated instruction shall not be included in the calculation of a student’s grade point average.</P>
F.</P><P>Transportation to and from class is the responsibility of the parent/guardian.</P>
G.</P><P>Once approved, the student must be enrolled continuously throughout the school year.</P>
H.</P><P>The final decision regarding admission and placement for all home educated students enrolled in the District rests with the Superintendent.</P>
I.</P><P>The Superintendent shall have the right to evaluate a home educated student’s achievement and place the student in the appropriate grade level, should the student be re-enrolled in Springboro Community Schools.</P>
<P>Home educated-students will be permitted to take norm-referenced achievement/ability and state-mandated tests that are regularly scheduled for district students of similar age.  Students in grades 6-12 will be required to take state mandated proficiency tests if they are enrolled in reading, English, mathematics, science, and/or social studies courses.  These tests are given at selected grade levels and must be taken during the regular administration of the tests.  It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian to make arrangements for testing with the appropriate school.  Springboro Community Schools will not pay for testing outside the school district.  A student may take tests such as the PSAT, SAT, ACT, etc. normally given at school.  These tests will be administered at the same cost charged Springboro High School students.</P>
