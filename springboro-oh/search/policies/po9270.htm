<B><P>9270 - HOME EDUCATION</P></B>
The Board of Education requires that all resident students of compulsory schooling age attend a chartered public or nonpublic school as required by the Ohio Revised Code.  If a parent desires an exception in order to provide home instruction for a resident student of compulsory age, the parent must comply with the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code and the related administrative guidelines promulgated by the Ohio Department of Education.  These requirements must be met annually prior to a student’s participation in home education.<BR>
<P>The Board shall not allow a student who attends a nondistrict school to participate in any of the District's co-curricular or extra-curricular activities.  The Board shall allow a student who has been excused from attendance for home education to participate in any of the District’s co-curricular or extra-curricular activities, provided that the following standards have been met:</P>

These tests are given at selected grade levels and must be taken during the regular administration of the tests.
