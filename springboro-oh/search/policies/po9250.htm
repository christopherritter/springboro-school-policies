<B><P>9250 - RELATIONS WITH PARENTS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education believes that the education of children is a joint responsibility, one it shares with the parents of the school community.  To ensure that the best interests of the child are served in this process, a strong program of communication between home and school must be maintained.</P>
<P>The Board feels that it is the parents who the ultimate responsibility for their children's in-school behavior, including the behavior of students who have reached the legal age of majority, but are still for all practical purposes, under parental authority.  During school hours, the Board, through its designated administrators, acts in place of the parents.</P>
<P>The Board directs that the following activities be implemented to encourage parent-school cooperation through:</P>
