<B><P>4131 - REDUCTION IN STAFF</P></B>
<P>It is the responsibility of the Board of Education to provide appropriate staffing levels for the implementation of the educational program of the District and the operation of the schools and to do so efficiently and economically.</P>
<P>The Board reserves the right to reduce positions and to suspend the contracts of staff members pursuant to such reduction whenever reasons of decreased enrollment of students, return to duty of regular classified staff members after leaves of absence, suspension of schools or territorial changes affecting the District, or financial reasons so warrant.  In lieu of suspending an entire contract, the Board may suspend the contract of a staff member in part and provide a level of compensation commensurate with the percentage of work performed.</P>
<P>In making any such reduction, the Board will suspend contracts in accordance with the recommendation of the Superintendent who shall, within each pay classification affected, give preference first to employees on continuing contract and then to employees on the basis of seniority.</P>
<P>Continuing contract employees whose contracts are suspended shall have a right to restoration of employment in order of seniority of service in the District if a non-teaching position for which the employee is qualified becomes vacant or is created.  Such continuing contract employees will not forfeit such right to restoration by reason of having declined recall to a position with fewer hours.</P>
For covered employees, such reduction shall be in accordance with the terms of the negotiated, collectively-bargained agreement(s) entered into prior to September&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2005.  Reductions occurring under collective bargaining agreements entered into by the District after September&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2005, will be in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement(s), but only to the extent that such terms do not conflict with the requirements of Section 3319.172 of the Ohio&nbsp;Revised Code as described above.<BR>
<P>This law cannot be superseded by the negotiated contracts.</P>
<P>R.C. 3319.172</P>
