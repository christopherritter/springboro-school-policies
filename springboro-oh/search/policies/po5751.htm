<B><P>5751 - PARENTAL STATUS OF STUDENTS</P></B>
<P>No student, whether married or unmarried, who is otherwise eligible to attend school in the District shall be denied an educational program solely because of pregnancy, childbirth, pregnancy-related disabilities, or actual or potential parenthood.</P>
<P>The Board of Education reserves the right to require as a prerequisite for attendance in the regular classes of the schools and the co-curricular and extra-curricular programs of the schools that each pregnant student present to the Superintendent her physician's written statement that such activity will not be injurious to her health nor jeopardize her pregnancy.</P>
<P>A pregnant student will be considered on an excused absence for so long a period as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician.  At the conclusion of the absence, the student shall be reinstated to the status she held when the absence began.</P>
