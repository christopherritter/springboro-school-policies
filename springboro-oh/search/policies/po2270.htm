<P>Based on the First Amendment requirement for separation of the church and state, no devotional exercises or displays of a religious character will be permitted in the schools of this District in the conduct of any program or activity under the jurisdiction of the Board. Instructional activities shall not be permitted to advance or inhibit any particular religion or religion generally.</P>
<P>An understanding of religions and their effects on civilization is essential to the thorough education of young people and to their appreciation of a pluralistic society.  To that end, the curriculum shall be developed to include, as appropriate to the various ages and attainments of the students, instruction about the religions of the world.</P>
<P>The Board acknowledges the degree to which a religious consciousness has permeated the arts, literature, music, and issues of morality.  It also acknowledges that instructional and resource materials approved for use in the District’s schools frequently contain religious references or concern moral issues that have traditionally been the focus of religious concern.  That such materials may be religious in nature shall not, by itself, bar their use in the District.  Teaching staff members using such materials shall attempt to avoid using them to advance or inhibit religion in any way.</P>
<P>The Board also recognizes that religious traditions vary in their doctrines and perceptions held regarding the natural world and its processes.  The curriculum shall be chosen for its place in the education of the students of this District, rather than for its conformity to religious principles.</P>
<P>No student shall be exempted from taking a required course of study on the grounds that the instruction therein interferes with the free exercise of his/her religion.</P>
