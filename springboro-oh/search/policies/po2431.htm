<P>The Board of Education recognizes the importance of family unity during holiday periods, the educational value of family vacations and the importance of religious services.  It is, therefore, the policy of the Board that a student’s participation in athletics, extra-curricular or co-curricular activities not be limited on the basis of missed practices or competitions during holiday periods or during a family approved vacation, trip, or due to attending a religious service.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this policy the following definitions will apply:</P>
<P>Holiday Periods shall be defined as Labor Day, Thanksgiving day, and the associated non-student days, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the associated non-student days, New Years Eve, New Years Day, Martin Luther King Day, Presidents Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Spring Break, and the associated non-student days, Memorial Day, Independence Day, all Sundays, and Summer Break, but just the associated non-student days from August 1<SUP>st</SUP> to the first day of school or Labor Day, whichever occurs first.</P>
<P>The High School Athletic Director and/or building principal in the case of non-athletic activities may schedule for students in grades nine through twelve, competitions and events as appropriate, during the holiday period’s associated non-student days described above.  Participation by students in such events is not required, but shall be optional.</P>
<P>The Junior High Athletic Director and/or building principal, in the case of non-athletic activities, shall not schedule for students in grades seven and eight any competitions or events during the Holiday Periods described above.  The only events, which may be scheduled on any of those days, are those, which are scheduled by our athletic league or governing/controlling body of that competition without any local option to not schedule the event.  Participation by students in such events is not required, but shall be optional.</P>
<P>Should it be necessary and/or appropriate for a coach, director, or advisor to schedule a practice during a holiday period described above due to extenuating circumstances such as the timing of a tournament game, competition, or season opener, such practices must be approved in advance by the Superintendent of Schools.  Participation by students in such practices is not required, but shall be optional.</P>
<P>However, the coach, director, or advisor may limit participation after the student’s return if the student’s absence, in fact, resulted in a lack of material preparedness or physical condition.  If any such limitation is imposed, the coach, director, or advisor shall immediately advise the student of the nature of and reason(s) for such limits, and shall assist the student in normalizing his/her level of participation as quickly as possible.</P>
