<P>The Board of Education recognizes the value to providing students with experiences as part of their preparation for productive employment and appreciates the cooperation of local employers in accommodating such training activities at their places of business.</P>
<P>Board policy 2421 authorizes the Superintendent to develop work-site training programs as part of the vocational education curriculum.  S/He shall develop administrative guidelines whereby all such programs are reviewed to determine whether or not an employer relationship has been established according to criteria established by the Supreme Court in adjudicating cases related to the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Particular attention should be paid to community-based programs for special education students and to vocational education programs in which students are producing goods or services for sale and the District is the recipient of the income therefrom.</P>
