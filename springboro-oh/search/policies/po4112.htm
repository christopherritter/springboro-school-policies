<B><P>4112 - BOARD-STAFF COMMUNICATIONS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education desires to maintain open channels of communication between itself and the staff.  The basic line of communication, will, however, be through the Superintendent.</P>
<P>A.</P><P><B>Staff&nbsp;Communications&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Board<BR></<P>
<P></B>Communications from staff members to the Board or its committees shall be submitted through the Superintendent.  The Superintendent shall forward such communications received from staff members to the Board.  This procedure is not intended to deny any staff member his/her constitutional right of free speech or the right to appeal to or otherwise address the Board on important matters through established procedures.</P>
<P>B.</P><P><B>Board&nbsp;Communications&nbsp;to&nbsp;Staff<BR></<P>
<P></B>All official communications, policies, and directives of the Board of staff interest and concern to the staff will generally be communicated through the Superintendent, who shall also keep staff members fully informed of the Board's concerns, and actions.</P>
<P>C.</P><P><B>Social&nbsp;Interaction<BR></<P>
<P></B>Both staff and Board members share an interest in the schools and in education generally, and it is to be expected that when they interact at social affairs and other functions, they will informally discuss such matters as educational trends, issues, and innovations, and general activities of the District.  However, since Board members are not authorized to act on behalf of the Board unless in open public session or when specifically vested with such authority, Board members and members of the staff should not discuss individual personalities, personnel grievances, or other complaints.  Instead, such matters should be addressed in accordance with the procedures established in Board Policy or the collective bargaining agreement.</P>
