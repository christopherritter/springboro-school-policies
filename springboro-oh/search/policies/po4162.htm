<P>The Board of Education believes that the safety of students while being transported to and from school or school activities is of utmost importance and is the primary responsibility of the driver of the school vehicle.  To fulfill such a responsibility, each driver, as well as others who perform safety-sensitive functions with Board-owned and/or operated ("Board-owned") vehicles must be mentally and physically alert at all times while on duty.  To that end, the Board has established this policy and others related to employees' health and well-being.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy and the guidelines associated with the policy, the following definitions shall apply.</P>

<P>The Board expects all CDL license holders to comply with Board Policy 4122.01 on Drug Free Schools which prohibits the possession, use, sale, or distribution of alcohol and any controlled substance on school property at all times.  Further, the Board concurs with the Federal requirement that all CDL license holders should be free of any influence of alcohol or controlled substance while on duty.</P>
<P>The Board directs the Superintendent to establish a drug and alcohol testing program whereby each regular and substitute bus driver, as well as any other staff member who holds a CDL license, is tested for the presence of alcohol in his/her system as well as for the presence of controlled substances.</P>
<P>The tests are to be conducted, a)  in accordance with Federal and State regulations b.) prior to employment, c.) for reasonable cause, d.) upon return to duty after any alcohol or drug rehabilitation, e.) after any accident, f.) on a random basis, and g.)&nbsp;on a follow-up basis.</P>
<P>Any staff member who tests positive shall be prohibited from performing or continuing to perform his/her safety-sensitive functions (e.g., driving any Board-owned transportation vehicle) and be referred to the District's Employee Assistance Program.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if during any test the lab determines that an adulterant has been added to the specimen, then the test will be considered positive and the employee shall be prohibited from driving any school vehicle and be referred to the District's Employee Assistance Program.</P>
<P>Any staff member who refuses to submit to a test shall be prohibited from performing or continuing to perform his/her safety-sensitive functions (e.g., driving any Board-owned transportation vehicle).</P>
