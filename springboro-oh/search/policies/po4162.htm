<B><P>4162 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING OF DRIVERS OF DISTRICT VEHICLES</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education believes that the safety of students while being transported to and from school or school activities is of utmost importance and is the primary responsibility of the driver of the school vehicle.  To fulfill such a responsibility, each driver, as well as others who perform safety-sensitive functions with Board-owned and/or operated ("Board-owned") vehicles must be mentally and physically alert at all times while on duty.  To that end, the Board has established this policy and others related to employees' health and well-being.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy and the guidelines associated with the policy, the following definitions shall apply.</P>
<P>A.</P><P>The term <I>illegal drug</I> means drugs and controlled substances, the possession or use of which is unlawful, pursuant to Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>The term <I>controlled substance</I> includes any illegal drug and any drug that is being used illegally, such as a prescription drug that was not legally obtained or not used for its intended purposes or in its prescribed quantity.  The term does not include any legally-obtained prescription drug used for its intended purpose in its prescribed quantity unless such use would impair the individual's ability to safely perform safety-sensitive functions.</P>
<P>C.</P><P>The term <I>controlled substance abuse</I> includes excessive use of alcohol as well as prescribed drugs not being used for prescribed purposes, in a prescribed manner, or in the prescribed quantity.</P>
<P>D.</P><P>The term <I>safety-sensitive functions</I> includes all tasks associated with the operation and maintenance of Board-owned transportation vehicles.</P>
<P>E.</P><P>The term <I>CDL license holder</I> means all regular and substitute bus drivers as well as other staff members who may drive students in Board-owned vehicles or inspect, repair, and maintain Board-owned transportation vehicles.</P>
<P>F.</P><P>The term <I>while on duty</I> means all time from the time the CDL license holder begins to work or is required to be in readiness for work until the time s/he is relieved from work and all responsibility for performing work.</P>
<P>The Board expects all CDL license holders to comply with Board Policy 4122.01 on Drug Free Schools which prohibits the possession, use, sale, or distribution of alcohol and any controlled substance on school property at all times.  Further, the Board concurs with the Federal requirement that all CDL license holders should be free of any influence of alcohol or controlled substance while on duty.</P>
<P>The Board directs the Superintendent to establish a drug and alcohol testing program whereby each regular and substitute bus driver, as well as any other staff member who holds a CDL license, is tested for the presence of alcohol in his/her system as well as for the presence of controlled substances.</P>
<P>The tests are to be conducted, a)  in accordance with Federal and State regulations b.) prior to employment, c.) for reasonable cause, d.) upon return to duty after any alcohol or drug rehabilitation, e.) after any accident, f.) on a random basis, and g.)&nbsp;on a follow-up basis.</P>
<P>Any staff member who tests positive shall be prohibited from performing or continuing to perform his/her safety-sensitive functions (e.g., driving any Board-owned transportation vehicle) and be referred to the District's Employee Assistance Program.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if during any test the lab determines that an adulterant has been added to the specimen, then the test will be considered positive and the employee shall be prohibited from driving any school vehicle and be referred to the District's Employee Assistance Program.</P>
<P>Any staff member who refuses to submit to a test shall be prohibited from performing or continuing to perform his/her safety-sensitive functions (e.g., driving any Board-owned transportation vehicle).</P>
