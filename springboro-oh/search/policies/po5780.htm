<P>The Board of Education recognizes that students possess not only the right to an education but many ofthe rights of citizenship as well.</P>
<P>In granting students the education to which they are entitled, the Board shall provide them with the nurture, counsel, and custodial care appropriate to their age and maturity.  At the same time, the Board recognizes that no student may be deprived of the basic right to equal access to the educational program, and his/her constitutional right to due process and free expression and association as appropriate for the school environment.</P>
<P>Attendant upon the rights afforded to each student are certain responsibilities, which include respect for the rights of others, obedience to properly constituted school authority, and compliance with the administrative guidelines of this District.</P>
<P>A student who has reached the age of majority possesses the full rights of an adult and may authorize those school matters previously handled by his/her parents.</P>
<P>Parents also have rights in the school system to know about their student’s educational experience.  Specific rights are listed in topic areas of these policies.</P>
<P>In addition, parents have the right to inspect any instructional materials used as part of the educational curriculum for their student.  Instructional materials means instructional content, regardless of format, that is provided to the student, including printed or representational materials, audio-visual materials, and materials available in electronic or digital formats (such as materials accessible through the Internet).  Instructional material does not include academic tests or academic assessments.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall, in consultation with parents, develop a procedure addressing the right of parents as described herein and procedures to assure timely response to parental requests to review instructional material.  The procedure shall also address reasonable notification to parents and students of their rights to review these materials.  See AG 9130A and Form 9130 F3.</P>
