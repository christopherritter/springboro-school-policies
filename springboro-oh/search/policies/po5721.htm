<B><P>5721 - STUDENT SPONSORED PUBLICATIONS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education respects the right of students to express themselves and to distribute printed materials as a part of that expression, but recognizes that the exercise of that right must be limited by the responsibility to maintain an orderly school environment and to protect the rights of all members of the school community.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "publications" shall include any written or printed cards, letters, circulars, books, pamphlets, notices, banners, newspapers, or other like materials but shall not include any newspaper, periodical, or book the publication of which is sponsored by this Board.</P>
<P>Such publications may include material not prepared by the student himself/herself.</P>
<P>The Board reserves the right to designate and prohibit the distribution of publications which are not protected by the right of free expression because they violate the rights of others.  Such unprotected materials include but are not limited to those which:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>are grossly prejudicial to an ethnic, religious, racial, or other delineated group;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>libel any specific person or persons;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>seek to establish the supremacy of a particular religious denomination, sect, or point of view over any other religious denomination, sect, or point of view;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>advocate the use or advertise the availability of any substance or material which may reasonably be believed to constitute a direct and substantial danger to the health of students;</P>
<P>E.</P><P>contain obscenity or material otherwise deemed to be harmful to impressionable students who may receive them;</P>
<P>F.</P><P>incite violence, advocate the use of force or urge the violation of law or school guidelines;</P>
<P>G.</P><P>advertise goods or services for the benefit of profit making organizations;</P>
<P>H.</P><P>fail to identify the student or organization responsible for distribution;</P>
<P>I.</P><P>are offered for sale to other students;</P>
<P>J.</P><P>solicit funds for nonschool organizations or institutions when such solicitations have not been approved by the Board.</P>
<P>The Board shall require that students who wish to distribute materials must submit them for prior review.  Where the reviewer cannot show within two (2) school days that the materials are unprotected, or where unprotected material is deleted or modified so as to be no longer unprotected, such material may be distributed.  Appeal from prior review shall be permitted to the Superintendent and Board in accordance with District rules.</P>
<P>The Board shall require that the distribution of printed materials take place only at the places and during the times set forth in the administrative guidelines of this District in order that such distribution not interfere with the orderly operation of the schools.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall develop administrative guidelines for the distribution of student publications.</P>
