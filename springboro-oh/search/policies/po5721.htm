<P>The Board shall require that students who wish to distribute materials must submit them for prior review.  Where the reviewer cannot show within two (2) school days that the materials are unprotected, or where unprotected material is deleted or modified so as to be no longer unprotected, such material may be distributed.  Appeal from prior review shall be permitted to the Superintendent and Board in accordance with District rules.</P>
<P>The Board shall require that the distribution of printed materials take place only at the places and during the times set forth in the administrative guidelines of this District in order that such distribution not interfere with the orderly operation of the schools.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall develop administrative guidelines for the distribution of student publications.</P>
