<P>The Board encourages employees, parents, students and community members to check the District's website regularly for changes to these resources and for the addition of other resources.  Some resources may require a user name and password, or a login procedure due to the personally identifiable nature of the information provided through that resource (e.g., the gradebook program and e-mail system).  If a user name and password, or login procedure, is necessary to access a resource, information shall be provided on the website explaining who is eligible for a user name and password, how to obtain a user name and password, and detailed instructions concerning the login process.</P>
<P>Board members, District employees, students, and parents are permitted to use their personally-owned or District-owned computers or workstations and/or web-enabled devices of any type to remotely (i.e. away from District property and facilities) access the Network.  This policy is limited to remote access connections that are used to do work on behalf of or for the benefit of the District, including, but not limited to, reading or sending e-mail and reviewing District-provided intranet web resources and completing assigned coursework.</P>
<P>Each individual granted remote access privileges pursuant to this policy must adhere to the following standards and regulations:</P>
