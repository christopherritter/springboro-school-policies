<BODY><B><P>5512.03 - USE OF DRUG, ALCOHOL, AND TOBACCO IN ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES</P></B>
<B><P>ATHLETIC CODE OF CONDUCT</P></B>
<P>Participation in an athletic activity at Springboro Junior High and Senior High School is a privilege, not a right. Students participating in athletic activities represent the entire Springboro Junior High and Senior High School student population in local, State, regional, and National events. This representation of the school District carries with it the additional responsibility of maintaining the highest personal and ethical conduct.</P>
<P>As used in this policy the term &quot;student athlete&quot; includes those students participating in extra-curricular athletic activities as players, managers, or student assistants in school district sponsored athletic activities including, but not limited to, sports teams and cheerleading.</P>
<B><P>THE CODE OF CONDUCT</P></B>
<P>Any student athlete participating in an athletic department recognized activity shall not illegally use or have in his/her possession, in any form, alcohol, tobacco, other drugs or drug paraphernalia. A student athlete who aids or assists another in committing any of the above infractions shall be deemed equally responsible for the offense and shall receive the same consequence.</P>
<P>Participants should conduct themselves both in and out of school in a manner that reflects good citizenship. Any behavior that results in dishonor to the participant, his/her team, or his/her school will not be tolerated. Acts of unacceptable conduct include, but are not limited to, theft, vandalism, disrespect, and violation of the law.</P>
<B><P>LIFETIME OF CODE</P></B>
<P>Student athlete will be considered "participants" and bound by the Code of Conduct beginning from the date of the first practice to the date of the last game, match, or event. No student athlete shall be allowed to participate in any activity with a group/team until they have signed an agreement to follow the code and it has been turned in to their coach/advisor. The student athlete’s parents are also required to sign the agreement acknowledging their son/daughter/custodial child’s agreement to follow the Athletic Code of Conduct. If the participant is trying out for a group with limited numbers (i.e. "cuts" occur) and are "cut" they no longer will be considered a &quot;participant&quot; bound by this policy.</P>
<B><P>INFRACTION PROCEDURE</P></B>
<P>All alleged infractions involving student athletes will be referred to the Athletic Director. S/he will determine if an infraction has occurred. If it is determined that an infraction has occurred, it is the responsibility of the Athletic Director to notify, in writing, the participant, the participant's parents, and the participant's coaches/advisors.</P>
<B><P>APPEALS</P></B>
<P>A written request for an appeal should be directed to the Superintendent, and must occur within seven (7) calendar days following notification of the infraction. The participant will not be allowed to participate in contests/events during the appeal process. The Superintendent will hear the appeal and arrive at a final decision on the case. There will be no further appeals. Appeals shall be heard promptly to avoid unnecessarily penalizing a student athlete that is found not guilty on appeal.</P>
<B><P>DENIAL OF INVOLVEMENT CLAUSE (LYING)</P></B>
<P>If any participant denies their involvement in a tobacco, alcohol, or substance related situation and is later found to have been involved by the athletic director or building principal, their consequences will be doubled.</P>
<B><P>CONSEQUENCES</P></B>
<B><P>Drugs, Alcohol &amp; Tobacco</P></B>
<P>A.</P>
<P>First Offense:</P>
<P>The participant will not participate in the next contests/events, beginning with the first contest/event in which s/he would participate after determination that an infraction has occurred, equal to twenty percent (20%) of the number of regular scheduled contests/events. The participant will also be referred to a Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor. The participant will be permitted to practice during the time period of his/her activity suspension. The participant's reinstatement and eligibility will be determined by the Athletic Director.</P>
<P>OR:</P>
<P>The number of contests/events to be suspended from can be reduced to ten percent (10%) if the participant agrees to complete twenty (20) hours of approved community service within forty-five (45) days of determination that an infraction has occurred. Failure to comply with this will add an additional twenty percent (20%) suspension at the end of forty-five (45) days plus all awards will be revoked. Proof of an approved community service plan being in place must be presented to the Athletic Director prior to being reinstated to participate after the ten percent (10%) suspension has been served. All other consequences relating to intervention, practice, reinstatement, and eligibility remain the same.</P>
<P>B.</P>
<P>Second Offense:</P>
<P>The participant will not participate in any Springboro Junior High and/or Senior High School activity for one (1) calendar year from the date of determination that a second infraction has occurred. The participant will also be referred to a Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor. The participant will not be permitted to take part in any events during this time period. The participant's reinstatement and eligibility will be determined by the Athletic Director.</P>
<P>OR:</P>
<P>The suspension can be reduced to twenty percent (20%) of the scheduled contests if the participant agrees to complete forty (40) hours of approved community service within ninety (90) days of determination that an infraction has occurred. Failure to comply with this will result in a year suspension beginning at the end of ninety (90) days. All other consequences relating to intervention, reinstatement, and eligibility remain the same.</P><P>C.</P>
<P>Third Offense:</P>
<P>The participant will not be eligible for further participation in any Springboro Junior High and Senior High School activities for the remainder of their Jr. High and/or Senior High school career. The participant may apply for reinstatement at the conclusion of one (1) calendar year from the date of determination that an infraction has occurred. This application should be made to the Athletic Director in writing and must include proof of completing an intervention program with, or approved by, the Springboro Crisis Intervention Counselor and also proof of completing 100 hours of approved community service during this year's suspension. The participant's reinstatement and eligibility will be determined by the Athletic Director.</P><P>D.</P>
<P>Fourth Offense:</P>
<P>The student shall be denied participation in all athletic department recognized activities for the duration of his/her career at Springboro Junior High and High School.</P>
<P>When applying the ten percent (10%), or twenty percent (20%) rule, a partial number of contests/events results, the number will be rounded down to arrive at the length of the suspension. (i.e. 20% of 27 = 5.4 which would be a suspension of five (5) games/events)</P>
<B><P>RELATED INFORMATION</P></B>
<P>If the group/sport season or the school year ends while the participant is serving the suspension for a Code of Conduct rule infraction, the balance of the suspension will roll over to the beginning of the next season the participant is involved in. The number of contests/events to be missed will be determined by applying the percentage rule to the number of regular scheduled events of the activity the participant was involved in when the infraction occurred. If the participant is not involved in an activity when the infraction occurs, the number of contests/events to be misses will be determined by applying the percentage rule to the number of regular scheduled events of the next activity the participant is involved in.</P>
<P>If a suspension as a result of a Code of Conduct infraction has not been completed at the conclusion of a season, the participant may attend the awards program but, is ineligible to receive any special Springboro Junior High and/or Senior High School individual or team/group awards. In addition, any first offense, second offense, third offense, or subsequent offense consequences will also be applied.</P>
<P>A coach/advisor may impose additional consequences on their participants who violate the Code of Conduct.</P>
<P>For each infraction, all leadership positions (including, but not limited to, captain, president, vice-president, etc.) will be denied.</P>
<P>For each infraction, no "special" individual or team/group awards will be awarded. Outside scholarships may be given at the discretion of the group giving the scholarship.</P>
<P>Consequences under this Athletic Code of Conduct may be in addition to consequences for the violation for other policies, rules, or regulations established by Springboro Junior High or Springboro High School.</P>
<P>Any award which the participant is still to be granted will not be given until after any suspension, community service, or intervention obligation has been completed.</P>
<P>Community service hours assigned by Springboro Junior High and/or Senior High School will be considered the maximum number of hours assigned including any hours which may have been assigned by the court system for the same offense. (i.e. if the infraction calls for forty (40) hours to be assigned and the court system assigns twenty (20), then Springboro Junior High and/or Senior High School will only assign twenty (20) hours to bring the total to forty (40) hours).</P>
<P>During the time of the suspension, the participant may attend his/her group or team's events at the coach/advisor's discretion but may not be in uniform or in the group/team area during any type of contest/event.</P>
