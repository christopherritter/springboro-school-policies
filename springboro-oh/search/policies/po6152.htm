<B><P>6152 - STUDENT FEES, FINES, AND CHARGES</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education may levy certain charges to students to facilitate the utilization of adequate, appropriate learning materials used in the course of instruction.  If the Superintendent or designee determines that a student is in serious financial need, s/he may choose to provide any or all such materials free of charge upon written request of the parent/guardian on a form designed by the District.</P>
<P>A charge shall not exceed the combined cost of the material used, freight and/or handling charges, and nominal add-on for loss.  Money received from resale of such material shall be forwarded to the Treasurer with an accurate accounting of all transactions.</P>
<B><P>Fines</P></B>
<P>When school property, equipment, or supplies are damaged, lost, or taken by a student, a fine will be assessed.  The fine will be reasonable, seeking only to compensate the school for the expense or loss incurred.</P>
<P>The late return of borrowed books or materials from the school libraries will be subject to appropriate fines.</P>
<P>All fines collected will be sent to the Treasurer for deposit in the appropriate fund.</P>
<P>Any fees, fines, and/or other charges collected by members of the staff that total more than $1,000.00 or that cannot be safeguarded shall be turned in to the Treasurer within one (1) business day after collection.  Any fees, fines, and/or charges collected by members of the staff that total less than $1,000.00 and that can be safeguarded shall be turned in to the Treasurer within three (3) business days after collection.  A place such as the building safe or a locked file cabinet shall be designated in each building and shall be used for securing these monies until they are deposited with the Treasurer.  At no time shall any staff member place public monies in his/her own banking accounts or commingle public monies with their own.  Except in cases of extenuating circumstances, i.e., the inability to access the secure place in the building, public monies should not be taken to a person’s place of residence.</P>
<P>In accordance with R.C. 3313.642, failure to pay fees and fines may result in the withholding of grades cards and credit.  In the event the above course of action does not result in the fee being collected, the Board authorizes the Treasurer to take the appropriate action to collect the fees and fines.</P>
<P>Nothing in this policy restricts the right of access of a parent or student to school records or to receive copies of such records, as required by Federal and State laws.</P>
