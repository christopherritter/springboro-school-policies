<B><P>2110 - STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY</P></B>
<P>Education in the Springboro Community City School District is a dynamic, interactive process involving students, faculty, parents, and the community.  This educational process uses the facilities and other resources of the School District, but is not limited by them.  In particular, volunteerism by parents and community members is encouraged.</P>
<P>The central objective of the Springboro Community City School District is to help young people maximize their potential for success as responsible members of our democratic society, as participants in the free enterprise system, and as individuals who have a strong and positive sense of self-worth.</P>
<P>For the educational process to be effective, it must recognize and adhere to certain philosophical principles.  The Board of Education believes that the following are particularly important:</P>
