<P>The Board of Education recognizes its position as a major purchaser in this community, and while it is the intention of the Board to purchase materials and supplies of quality at the lowest possible cost through widespread competition, if all other considerations are equal, the Board prefers to purchase within the District from established local merchants.</P>
