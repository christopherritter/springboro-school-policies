<B><P>8442.01 - WORKERS’ COMPENSATION</P></B>
<P>The Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) provides insurance coverage to employees for work-related injuries sustained in the course of and arising out of employment and diseases contracted in the course of employment.  It also provides benefits to employees' dependents in those cases of death suffered in the course of and arising out of employment.  To that end, if an employee sustains a workplace injury or contracts an occupational disease, s/he may be eligible to receive compensation and benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act for loss sustained on account of an injury or illness.</P>
