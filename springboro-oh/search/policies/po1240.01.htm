<P>The Board of Education has an obligation to the citizens of this District to employ the professional leadership best trained and equipped to meet the educational needs of their children.  It shall meet that obligation by retaining only the best qualified person as Superintendent of Schools for this District.</P>
<P>If the services of the Superintendent are found on the basis of one or more evaluations to be unsatisfactory to the Board, s/he shall be notified by the Treasurer and given an opportunity to correct the conditions.</P>
<P>If the Board determines not to renew the Superintendent's contract, the Superintendent shall be notified in writing by the Treasurer, as approved by the Board, of its intent, within the time frame required by State Statute, that his/her services will not be renewed.</P>
<P>The contract of the Superintendent may be terminated during its term in accordance with statutory procedures.</P>
<B><P>Reporting Professional Misconduct</P>
</B>
<P>Consistent with Policy <A HREF='po8141.htm'><B>8141</B></A> and State law, the Board will file a report to the Ohio Department of Education, on forms provided for that purpose, matters of professional misconduct on the part of the Superintendent, as a licensed professional, including a conviction of the Superintendent of certain enumerated crimes and/or conduct which is determined to be unbecoming to the teaching profession.  Reports of any investigation regarding whether or not the Superintendent has committed an act or offense for which the Board is required to make a report to the Ohio Department of Education shall be kept in the personnel file of the Superintendent.  Should the Ohio Department of Education determine that the results of that investigation do not warrant initiating an action suspending, revoking, or otherwise limiting the Superintendent's license, the report(s) of any investigation will be moved to a separate public file.</P>
