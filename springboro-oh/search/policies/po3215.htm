<B><P>3215 - USE OF TOBACCO BY PROFESSIONAL STAFF</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education is committed to providing students, staff, and visitors with a tobacco and smoke-free environment.  The negative health effects of tobacco use for both users and nonusers, particularly in connection with second hand smoke, are well established.  Further, providing non-smoking and a tobacco-free environment is consistent with the responsibilities of teachers and staff to be our positive role models for students.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "use of tobacco" means to chew or maintain any substance containing tobacco, including smokeless tobacco, in the mouth to derive the effects of tobacco, as well as all uses of tobacco, or tobacco substitutes, including cigars, cigarettes, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, any other matter or substances that contain tobacco, in addition to papers used to roll cigarettes and/or smoking of electronic, "vapor," or other substitute forms of cigarettes, clove cigarettes and any other lighted smoking devices for burning tobacco or any other substances.</P>
<P>In order to protect students and staff who choose not to smoke or use tobacco from an environment noxious to them, and because the Board does not condone smoking or the use of tobacco, the Board prohibits the use of tobacco or tobacco substitute products by professional staff members at all times within any enclosed facility owned or leased or contracted for by the Board, and in areas directly or indirectly under the control of the Board immediately adjacent to locations of ingress or egress to such facilities.  This prohibition extends to any Board-owned and/or operated vehicles used to transport students and to all other Board-owned and/or operated vehicles.  Such prohibition also applies to school grounds and/or any school-related event.</P>
