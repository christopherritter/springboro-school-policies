<B><P>6233 - AMENITIES FOR PARTICIPANTS AT MEETINGS AND/OR OTHER OCCASIONS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes the value in providing meals, refreshments, and/or other amenities for staff, students, citizens, advisory groups who participate in meetings and staff development sessions, or on other occasions as deemed appropriate by the administration.</P>
<P>The Board hereby affirms that these expenses do serve a valid and proper public purpose.  The Board believes that the &quot;public purpose&quot; served is the promotion of education, enhancement of morale, and rapport, and the encouragement of participation in said activities.  However, under no circumstances shall public funds be expended for the purchase of alcoholic beverages.</P>
<P>The Board further directs the Treasurer to include funds in the annual appropriations for the purchase of such amenities or to reimburse staff who incur such expenses if purchased in connection with meetings, staff development sessions, or other occasions deemed appropriate by the administration.</P>
<P>Adopted 6/28/05</P></BODY>
