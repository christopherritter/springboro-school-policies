<B><P>2262 - LATCH-KEY PROGRAMS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education is concerned about the growing number of children who are receiving insufficient care, nurture, or supervision when not attending school.  This has serious implications for their general well-being as well as for their ability to benefit from the school program to the extent they need or want to.</P>
<P>Since those children constitute a significant and growing portion of the student population, the Board shall seek to provide appropriate programs and services for these students, particularly in grades K through 5, by contracting for its facilities to be used by an outside organization specializing in latch-key programs.</P>
<P>No funds shall be expended for the program from the General Fund other than for:</P>
