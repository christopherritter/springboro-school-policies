<P>The School District Board of Education designates the Director of Education Services as the employee responsible for providing information about the ADA to others and receiving and resolving complaints about discrimination against the disabled.</P>
<P>Any person may file a complaint if s/he believes the Board has discriminated against him/her on account of a disability.  The person filing the complaint is called the "grievant" and the complaint will be called a "grievance".  A "grievant" who is a member of a bargaining unit covered by a negotiated agreement must use the grievance procedure in the negotiated agreement to resolve any "grievance".  All other employees must utilize the following procedure.</P>

<P>The Director of Education Services will investigate the grievance and respond within seven (7) calendar days.</P>
<P>When reviewing the grievance, the Director of Education Services will determine whether the grievant is actually a "qualified person with a disability", whether the employer may have discriminated against the grievant, and whether the Board can reasonably accommodate the grievant or otherwise resolve grievant's problem.</P>
