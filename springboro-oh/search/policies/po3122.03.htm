The person filing the complaint is called the "grievant" and the complaint will be called a "grievance".  A "grievant" who is a member of a bargaining unit covered by a negotiated agreement must use the grievance procedure in the negotiated agreement to resolve any "grievance".  All other employees must utilize the following procedure.</P><TR><TD WIDTH="11%" VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</P>
