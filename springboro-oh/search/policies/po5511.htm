<B><P>5511 - DRESS AND GROOMING</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes that each student's mode of dress and grooming is a manifestation of personal style and individual preference. The Board will not interfere with the right of students and their parents to make decisions regarding their appearance except when their choices affect the educational program of the schools.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the Superintendent to establish a reasonable dress code in order to promote a safe and healthy school setting and enchance the educational environment.  The dress code shall be incorporated into each school building's Student Handbook and Discipline Code.  The building principal is designated as the arbiter of student dress and grooming in his/her building.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the Superintendent shall establish such grooming guidelines and procedures as are necessary to promote discipline, maintain order, secure the safety of students, and provide a healthy environment conducive to academic purposes.  Such guidelines shall prohibit student dress or grooming practices which:</P>
