<B><P>4211 - WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education expects all its employees to be honest and ethical in their conduct, and to comply with applicable State and Federal law, Board policies and administrative guidelines.  The Board encourages staff, students, parents, guardians, and citizens to report possible violations of those Board expectations to their immediate supervisors.</P>
<P>It is the responsibility of an employee who is aware of conduct on the part of any Board member or employee that possibly violates Federal or State law, Board policy, or standards of ethical conduct to call this conduct to the attention of his/her immediate supervisor.  If the employee's immediate supervisor is not responsive or is the employee whose behavior is in question, the employee may report to the Superintendent or Board President.  Students who are aware of potential violations of law, policy, or ethical conduct should discuss those with their parent or guardian.  Parents/guardians should report violations to the building Principal, Superintendent, or Board President.  Citizens should report violations to the Superintendent or Board President.</P>
<P>After such a report is made by an employee, the immediate supervisor will ask that employee's report be put in writing.  Parents, guardians, and citizens are encouraged to make reports in writing; however, reports made by other means will also be investigated.  Any employee, student, parent, guardian, or citizen making such a report in good faith shall be protected from discipline, retaliation, or reprisal for making such report.  However, employees are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for purposely, knowingly, or recklessly making a false report under this policy.</P>
<P>Employees found to have taken actions of retaliation or reprisal for a report protected by this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.</P>
<P>The Superintendent may develop administrative guidelines as necessary for implementation of this policy, including the development of forms upon which such reports may be made.</P>
