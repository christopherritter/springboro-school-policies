<BODY><B><P>7530 - LENDING OF SCHOOL OWNED EQUIPMENT</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education believes that Board-owned equipment is a valuable resource that may be loaned for community use under certain conditions only, provided that such use does not infringe on the original and necessary purpose of the equipment or interfere with the educational program of the schools.</P>
<P>The Board may lend specific items of equipment on the written request of the user and approval granted by the Superintendent. Such a request shall be made on a form prescribed by the District.</P>
<P>The user of Board-owned equipment shall be fully liable for any damage or loss occurring to the equipment during the period of its use, and shall be responsible for its safe return. The use of Board-owned equipment off school property is subject to the same rules and conditions of use that are in effect when the equipment is used on school property.</P>
<P>School equipment may be removed from school property by students or staff members and/or Board members only when such equipment is necessary to accomplish tasks arising from their school or job responsibilities. The consent of the principal is required for such removal.</P>
<P>Individuals authorized to use Board-owned equipment off school property may not allow anyone else to use the equipment.</P>
