The Board Service Fund shall be set aside from the General Fund, on an annual basis, by resolution of the Board and shall be used to pay expenses actually incurred by Board members in the performance of the official duties.  Such fund may also be used to pay for the expenses actually incurred by newly elected Board members relative to training and orientation to the performance of their duties prior to taking office.  Appropriations from this fund shall not exceed the sum specified by R.C. 3315.15 in any one school year.</P>
<P>An annual appropriations resolution shall be developed, approved, and filed according to statute and the requirements of the Auditor of the State of Ohio. </P>

<P>The Board shall adopt as part of its annual appropriation measure a spending plan (also known as a forecast), as prescribed by statute, or in the case of an amendment or supplement to an appropriation measure, an amended spending plan setting forth a projection of revenue, expenditures, and assumptions.  The forecast shall include the General Fund, any special cost center associated with General Fund money, Emergency Levy funds, any Debt Service activity that would otherwise have gone to the General Fund, DPIA, and Poverty Based Assistance (PBA) funds.  A copy of the annual appropriation measure and any amendment or supplement to it and the spending plan or amended plan shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and shall set forth all revenues available for appropriation by the District during such year and their sources; the nature and amount of expenses to be incurred during the year; the outstanding and unpaid expenses on the date the measure, amendment, or supplement</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=3 COLOR="#0000ff"> </B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="arial, helvetica, verdana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>is adopted; the dates by which such expenses must be paid; and any other information the Superintendent or State law requires.</P>
