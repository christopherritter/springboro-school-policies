<P>It is the policy of the Board of Education to permit the use of a reverse auction to purchase services and supplies whenever it is determined that the reverse auction process will be advantageous to the District (e.g., results in a cost savings to the District.)  To that end, vendors may submit proposals when competing to sell services and/or supplies in an open environment via the Internet.  While the reverse auction process may be used to purchase supplies such as equipment, materials, tangible assets and insurance, the process may not be used to purchase real property or interests in real property.  The process may also be used to purchase services such as the furnishing of labor, time, or effort by a person, provided such services do not involve the delivery of a specific end product other than a report, and are not being furnished in connection with an employment agreement or collective bargaining agreement.</P>
<P>The Board will provide notice of the request for proposals and award contracts in accordance with the Superintendent’s administrative guidelines.  When competitive sealed bidding and/or competitive sealed proposals for the purchase of services or supplies are required by law, purchases made by reverse auction will satisfy such legal requirement.</P>
