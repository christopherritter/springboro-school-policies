<B><P>9700 - RELATIONS WITH SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS</P></B>
<P>Any request from civic institutions or special interest groups which involve such activities as patriotic functions, contest, exhibits, sales of products to and by students, sending promotional materials home with students, graduation prizes, fund raising, and free teaching materials must be carefully reviewed to ensure that on balance such activities promote student interests without advancing the special interests of any particular group.</P>
<P>It is the policy of the Board of Education that students, staff members, and District facilities not be used for advertising or promoting the interests of any nonschool agency or organization, public or private, without the approval of the Board or its delegated representative; and, any such approval granted for whatever cause or group shall not be construed as an endorsement of said cause or group by this Board.</P>
<P>All materials or activities proposed by outside sources for student or staff use or participation shall be reviewed by the Superintendent on the basis of their educational value in the total school program; benefit to students; factual accuracy; good taste; and no such approval shall have the primary purpose of advancing the name, product, or special interest of the proposing group.</P>
<P>The Board shall permit the use of educational materials, programs, and equipment which contains commercial messages providing the content of such messages and the manner of presentation has been approved by the Superintendent and is in compliance with the District's administrative guidelines.</P>
<P>The Board recognizes that contests, exhibits, and the like may benefit individual students or the District as a whole, but participation in such special activities shall not:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>have the primary affect of advancing a special product, group, or company;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>make unreasonable demands upon the time and energies of staff or students or upon the resources of the District;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>involve any direct cost to the District;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>cause the participants to leave the School District, unless the Board policy for field trips has been followed.</P>
<P>No materials may be used or circulated in the schools or on the grounds of this District which are deemed to be primarily advertising or political materials, with the following exceptions:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>imprinted materials solicited by teachers as being suitable for a project or purpose of their class</P>
<P>B.</P><P>fliers of direct educational and cultural interest, and of an essentially noncommercial nature</P>
<P>C.</P><P>films bearing only the name of the sponsoring firm</P>
<P>Outside speakers representing commercial organizations will be welcome only when the commercial aspect is limited to naming the organization represented and the subject matter advances the educational aims of the District.</P>
<P>No staff member or student representing an outside organization may distribute or post literature on that organization's behalf on District property either during or after school hours without the permission and prior review of the principal.</P>
<P>Any outside organization or staff member wishing to solicit funds on school property must receive permission to do so from the Superintendent.</P>
<P>Permission to solicit funds will be granted only to those organizations or individuals whose purposes are consonant with the goals of this District and the interests of the community. Solicitation must take place at such times and places and in such a manner as is specified by the Superintendent and which does not interfere with the orderly operation of the schools.</P>
<P>The Board disclaims all responsibility for the protection of or accounting for such funds.</P>
<P>Solicited funds are not to be deposited in any regular or special accounts of the District.</P>
<P>A copy to this policy as well as the relevant administrative guidelines shall be given to any individual granted permission to solicit funds on District property.</P>
<P>This policy does not apply to the raising of funds for District-sponsored or school-sponsored activities.</P>
<P>The Board of Education is appreciative of the generosity of organizations which offer scholarships or prizes to deserving students in this District. But, in accepting the offer of such scholarships or prizes, the Board directs that these guidelines be observed:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>No information either academic or personal shall be released from the student's record for the purpose of selecting a scholarship or prize winner without the permission of the student who is eighteen (18), or the parents of a student who is younger in accordance with the Board's policy on student records.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>The building principal, together with a committee including staff members designated by the principal, shall be involved in the selection of the recipient.</P>
<B><P>Sale of School Supplies</P></B>
<P>In determining the appropriateness of the sale of school supplies by organizations other than the School District, the Board requires that:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>The organization have a purpose which will benefit the School District and its students.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>The organization's planned activities are clearly in the best interest of the School District and its students.</P>
<P>C.</P><P>The organization has submitted the following information and assurances, on the form provided by the District. A statement noting the purpose of the organization, financial accountability assurances and use of facility assurances.</P>
<P>D.</P><P>All funds generated by the sale of school supplies shall be kept separate from other activity funds or other transactions of the Board.</P>
<B><P>Surveys and Questionnaires</P></B>
<P>Neither district-related or nondistrict-related organizations shall be allowed to administer a survey or questionnaire to students or staff unless the instrument and the proposed plan is submitted, in advance, to the Superintendent. If approved, a copy of the results and the proposed manner of their communication are to be provided to him/her for review and approved before they are released.</P>
