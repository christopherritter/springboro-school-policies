<P>Any request from civic institutions or special interest groups which involve such activities as patriotic functions, contest, exhibits, sales of products to and by students, sending promotional materials home with students, graduation prizes, fund raising, and free teaching materials must be carefully reviewed to ensure that on balance such activities promote student interests without advancing the special interests of any particular group.</P>
<P>It is the policy of the Board of Education that students, staff members, and District facilities not be used for advertising or promoting the interests of any nonschool agency or organization, public or private, without the approval of the Board or its delegated representative; and, any such approval granted for whatever cause or group shall not be construed as an endorsement of said cause or group by this Board.</P>
<P>All materials or activities proposed by outside sources for student or staff use or participation shall be reviewed by the Superintendent on the basis of their educational value in the total school program; benefit to students; factual accuracy; good taste; and no such approval shall have the primary purpose of advancing the name, product, or special interest of the proposing group.</P>
<P>The Board shall permit the use of educational materials, programs, and equipment which contains commercial messages providing the content of such messages and the manner of presentation has been approved by the Superintendent and is in compliance with the District's administrative guidelines.</P>
<P>The Board recognizes that contests, exhibits, and the like may benefit individual students or the District as a whole, but participation in such special activities shall not:</P>
