<B><P>2464 - GIFTED EDUCATION AND IDENTIFICATION</P></B>
The Board of Education shall ensure that procedures are established to identify all gifted students.  The District follows the identification eligibility criteria as specified in Section 3324.03 of the Ohio Revised Code and the <I>Operating Standards for Identifying and Serving Gifted Students</I> as specified in the District Plan.<BR>

Annually, children who are gifted are identified by professionally qualified persons using a variety of assessment procedures.  The Board encourages efforts to provide services for the children who are gifted as an integral part of the total kindergarten through grade 12 program.  </P>
<P>The Superintendent or his/her designee shall identify children in grades kindergarten through twelve, who may be gifted in one or more of the following areas:</P>
