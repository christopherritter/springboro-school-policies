<B><P>4216 - EMPLOYEE DRESS AND GROOMING</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education believes that employees set an example in dress and grooming for their students to follow.  An employee who follows this principle improves the importance of his/her task, presents an image of dignity and encourages respect for authority.  These are positive factors for maintaining discipline.</P>
<P>The Board retains the authority to specify the following dress and grooming guidelines for employees, as a means of creating a positive impact on the educational process.  All employees shall, when assigned to District duty:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>be physically clean, neat, and well groomed;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>dress in a manner reflecting their assignment;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>dress in a manner that does not cause damage to District property;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>be groomed in such a way that their hair style or dress does not disrupt the educational process nor cause a health or safety hazard.</P>
<P>The employee's supervisor may, at his/her discretion and within the general guidelines of this policy, establish more definitive guidelines for dress and grooming necessary for maintaining a professional atmosphere.</P>
<P>If an employee thinks that an exception to this policy would enable him/her to carry out assigned duties more effectively, a request shall be made to the supervisor.</P>
<P>Adopted 3/18/88</P>
