<B><P>3310 - FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN NONINSTRUCTIONAL SETTINGS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education acknowledges the right of its employees, as citizens in a democratic society, to speak out on issues of public concern.  When those issues are related to the school system, however, the employee's expression must be balanced against the interests of this District.</P>
<P>The following guidelines are adopted by the Board to help clarify and therefore avoid situations in which the employee's expression could conflict with the District's interests.  In situations in which the employee is not engaged in the performance of professional duties s/he should:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>state clearly that his/her expression represents personal views and not necessarily those of the District or of other staff members;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>not discuss with others any individual with whom s/he would normally be in daily contact in the performance of duties, in order to avoid the disruption of cooperative staff relationships;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>refrain from expressions that would disrupt harmony among co-workers or interfere with the maintenance of discipline by school officials;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>not make abusive or personally defamatory comments about co-workers, administrators, or officials of the District;</P>
<P>E.</P><P>refrain from making public expressions which s/he knows to be false or are made without regard for truth or accuracy;</P>
<P>F.</P><P>not make threats against co-workers, supervisors, or District officials.</P>
<P>Violations of these guidelines may result in appropriate disciplinary action.</P>
