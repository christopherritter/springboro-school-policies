<BODY><B><P>3120.04 - EMPLOYMENT OF SUBSTITUTES</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes the need to procure the services of substitutes in order to continue the operation of the schools as a result of the absence of regular personnel.</P>
<P>The Superintendent or his/her designee shall employ substitutes for assignment as services are required to replace temporarily absent regular staff members and fill new positions. Such assignment of substitutes may be terminated when their services are no longer required.</P>
<P>Substitutes must possess a valid Ohio professional license or substitute license, unless the Superintendent believes the person's application information indicates the person has the qualifications to receive a teacher's license. Such a person may be employed on a conditional basis for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date the person submits a request for a license to the Department of Education through the date the Superintendent receives the person's valid teaching license. If the license is not delivered within the time period, the person's employment is to be terminated.</P>
<P>Substitutes also must pass a background check performed by the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (see Policy <A HREF='po3121.htm'><B>3121</B></A>).</P>
<P>Substitutes may be required to undergo a tuberculosis examination in accordance with law and at the direction of the Ohio Department of Health or the local health department.</P>
<P>In order to retain well-qualified substitutes for service in this District, the Board will offer competitive compensation at a rate set by the Board.</P>
<P>A substitute employed for more than sixty (60) days in one (1) specific position will be placed at the minimum salary on the current teachers' salary schedule (e.g. BA/0) and will be eligible for fringe benefits provided regular staff members.</P>
<P>Daily substitutes shall not earn sick leave nor be paid for days when students are not required to attend school.</P>
