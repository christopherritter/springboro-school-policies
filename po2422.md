2422 - HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
================================

The Board of Education believes that a well-balanced development of
sexual awareness and knowledge should be a part of the public school
program. This responsibility should be shared with the home and church.

The primary purpose of sex education instruction shall be to:

A. help students understand moral and ethical value decisions that
affect their sexuality;

B. promote wholesome family and interpersonal relationships;

C. help young people understand their sexuality;

D. promote good personal health practices.

The Board believes that it is appropriate to teach sex education in
coeducational classes.

Occasionally materials may be objectionable to some parents. In this
case, on the written request of the parent or guardian, the student may
be excused from attending such instruction and an alternative activity
may be provided.
