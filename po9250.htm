<H3>9250 - RELATIONS WITH PARENTS</H3>
<P>The Board of Education believes that the education of children is a joint responsibility, one it shares with the parents of the school community. To ensure that the best interests of the child are served in this process, a strong program of communication between home and school must be maintained.</P>
<P>The Board feels that it is the parents who the ultimate responsibility for their children's in-school behavior, including the behavior of students who have reached the legal age of majority, but are still for all practical purposes, under parental authority. During school hours, the Board, through its designated administrators, acts in place of the parents.</P>
<P>The Board directs that the following activities be implemented to encourage parent-school cooperation through:</P>
<P>A. parent-teacher conferences to permit two-way communication between home and school</P>
<P>B. open houses in District schools to provide parents with the opportunity to see the school facilities, meet the faculty, and sample the program on a first hand basis; each school in the District shall hold an open house at least annually</P>
<P>C. meetings of parents and staff members to explain and discuss matters of general interest with regard to child-school, child-home, or child-school-home relationships</P>
<P>D. meetings of staff members and groups of parents of those students having special abilities, disabilities, needs or problems</P>
<P>E. special events of a cultural, ethnic, or topical nature, which are initiated by parent groups, involve the cooperative effort of students and parents, and are of general interest to the schools or community</P>
<P>F. other activities established by District personnel to encourage parental participation in the schools</P>
