title: 5230 - LATE ARRIVAL AND EARLY DISMISSAL
---

{{ page.title }}
================

It is necessary that a student be in attendance throughout the school
day in order to benefit fully from the educational program of the
District.

The Board of Education recognizes, however, that from time to time
compelling circumstances will require that a student be late to school
or dismissed before the end of the school day.

The Board shall require that the school be notified in advance of such
absences by written request of the student's parent or guardian which
shall state the reason for the tardiness or early dismissal.

If one (1) parent has been awarded custody of the student in a divorce
settlement, the parent in custody as defined in statute shall submit
copies of the court order(s) to the school district.) Absent such
notice, the school will presume that the student may be released into
the care of either parent.

No student who has a medical disability which may be incapacitating may
be released from school without a person to accompany him/her.

No student shall be released from school to anyone whose signature
authorizing such custody is not on file in the building.
