================

One of the most important goals of the Board of Education is to attract
and employ personnel of the highest quality in all noncertificated
positions. It is the feeling of the Board that candidates selected for
employment in the School District, regardless of position, must be
devoted to the education and welfare of children. Furthermore, the Board
wishes to employ personnel who are motivated to do their best work at
all times. In all cases, the Superintendent shall recommend the best
qualified person for the position, regardless of the background,
experience, residence, and relationship to present employees or members
of the Board.
