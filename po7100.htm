<B><P>7100 - FACILITIES PLANNING</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes that careful, prudent planning is essential to the efficient operation of the schools and that planning must be grounded on accurate data. In order to assure that future District construction supports the educational program and responds to community needs, the Board will prepare a permanent improvements plan and will revise that plan periodically thereafter. The plan shall include a thorough description and analysis of local and regional demographic factors which influence general population growth and public school enrollments.</P>
<P>In order to apprise the Board of the continuing relevance of the Board's permanent improvements plan, the Superintendent shall:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>annually report to the Board on the number of resident students attending school by participating districts and the number of new residential units approved;</P>
<P>B.</P><P>report to the Board on the enrollment by grades during the school year annually;</P>
<P>C.</P><P>conduct a "kindergarten registration" each spring of the number of students who will be enrolled in the schools of the District in September of the year in which the estimate is made and report the results to the Board;</P>
<P>D.</P><P>prepare student population projections every year and compare the actual population figures to the previously projected figures to detect early for the benefit of the Board any changes in population trends.</P>
<P>In planning for the enlargement or modification of its facilities, the Board shall consider not only the number of children whose educational needs must be met, but also the physical requirements of the program it deems best suited to meet those needs. Each school building and site shall provide suitable accommodations to carry out the educational program of the school including provision for the disabled, pursuant to law and regulation.</P>
<P>Consideration shall be given to the use of buildings for vocational purposes offered by school districts participating in this District.</P>
