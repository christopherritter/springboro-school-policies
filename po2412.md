The Board of Education shall provide, pursuant to rules of the State
Board of Education, individual instruction to students of legal school
age who are not able to attend classes because of a physical or
emotional disability or illness.

Applications for individual instruction shall be made by the principal
and include a written statement by a physician licensed to practice in
Ohio. The statement shall certify the nature of the illness and state
the probable duration of the confinement. It must be approved by the
Special Education administrator.

An Individual Education Plan (IEP) or service plan shall be developed
indicating this program alternative as appropriate for meeting the
child's needs.

The program of home bound instruction given each student shall be in
accordance with rules of the State Board of Education with such
exceptions as may be recommended by the principal. Teachers shall hold
an Ohio teaching certificate appropriate for the level of instruction
for which the assignment is made.

The Board reserves the right to withhold home bound instruction when:

A. The teacher's health is at risk in the place of a student's
confinement.

B. A parent or other adult in authority is not at home with the student
during the hours of instruction.

The Superintendent shall develop procedures for implementing the policy
and which guard the privacy of each student placed on home instruction.
