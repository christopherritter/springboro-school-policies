<B><P>Legal Requirement</P></B>

<P>R.C. 3321.03: It is the parent's responsibility to cause the child to attend school.</P>
<B><P>Reporting Student Absences</P></B>
<P>It is the obligation and responsibility of the parent, guardian, or custodian to report the child's absence or tardy each day.</P>
<P>A.</P><P>The parent should phone the school by 10:00 a.m. on the day the student is absent. Afternoon kindergarten parents must call by 1:00 p.m.</P>

<P>3.</P><P>the name and telephone number of an emergency number designee to contact if the parent, custodial parent, guardian, legal guardian or other person having care and charge of a student cannot be reached.</P>

<P>H.</P><P>Head lice. Children excluded from school due to head lice are allowed two (2) excused absences (two (2) occurrences per year, maximum). Days beyond the two (2) day limit (two (2) occurrences per year) are unexcused.</P>
<P>I.</P><P>College visitation, juniors and seniors , maximum of three (3) days total for school year(Parent/student required to provide verification of the date and time of the visitation from the college, university or technical college).</P>
<P>J.</P><P>Emergencies and other reasons deemed good and sufficient by the principal.</P>
<B><P>Unexcused Absences and Tardies</P></B>
<P>The school administration will make the final decision whether an absence/tardy is excused or unexcused once the proper written documentation has been received regarding the absence/tardy. In general, unexcused absences/tardies include (but are not limited to):</P>
<P>A.</P><P>Missing the school bus.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>Experiencing transportation problems at home or on the way to school.</P>
<P>C.</P><P>Remaining at home to complete school assignments.</P>
<P>D.</P><P>Missing school without legitimate illness.</P>
<P>E.</P><P>Oversleeping. Alarm clock (student's or parent's) failed to work.</P>
<P>F.</P><P>"My mom didn't get me up."</P>
<P>G.</P><P>Not having suitable clothing to wear to school.</P>
<P>H.</P><P>Working at a job during the school day without a proper work permit.</P>
<P>I.</P><P>Babysitting.</P>

<P>K.</P><P>Personal business that can be done after school or on weekends.</P>
<P>L.</P><P>"Helping at home" or "was needed at home".</P>
<P>M.</P><P>"I had a game last night."</P>
<P>N.</P><P>Senior pictures/portraits.</P>
<B><P>Documentation of Absence/Tardy</P></B>
<P>Generally, up to eight (8) absences from school per school year or five (5) tardies to school per school year for the reasons identified as "excused absences" may be documented by a parent note. Absences in excess of eight (8) per school year or tardies in excess of five (5) per school year may not be excused by a parent and shall require documentation by the child's physician, etc.</P>
<P>The foregoing general rule is for the convenience of school officials in the administration of this attendance policy. This rule does not create an entitlement for a child to be absent from school eight (8) days per school year or tardy to school five (5) days per school year for reasons other than those identified for excused absences. Application of this general rule may be waived by school officials where circumstances indicate that its application does not serve the child's best interest. Those circumstances include, but are not limited to, the child's and/or the child's siblings' attendance in the current or prior school years.</P>
<P>Nothing contained in this attendance policy is intended nor should be construed as restricting the discretion of school officials to make such inquiries and request such verification/documentation as is reasonably necessary to determine if an absence/tardy is for any of the reasons identified in this policy as "excused absences".</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the Superintendent to establish a hearing and/or notification procedure for those students who have excessive absences/tardies.</P>
<B><P>Medical Excuses</P></B>
<P>Medical excuses are acceptable documentation of an absence or tardy to school following a personal, in-office examination by a physician. Doctors may only excuse absences or tardies to school for the specific dates the student was under his/her direct medical care (during which the student was medically unable to attend school). Excessive medical excuses may result in the school contacting the physician for additional medical documentation.</P>
<B><P>Tardy to School</P></B>
<P>Lateness to school and homeroom is not an excuse for missing class. When tardy after homeroom begins, students must be signed in personally in the office by an adult school official. A student is tardy to school when signing in to school during the first 102 minutes of the day.</P>
<P>Excessive tardiness may result in disciplinary action such as parent conferences, detention, letters from the county office, court action, and various types of suspension.</P>
<P>To be excused for a tardy, the attendance office and/or principal must receive a note and telephone call from the parent/guardian within one (1) day of the tardy.</P>
<P>For Truancy purposes only:</P>
<P>Important Note: Five (5) unexcused tardies = one (1) day unexcused absence.</P>
<B><P>Make-Up Work</P></B>
<P>Excused absences and tardies allow students to make-up all missed class work, tests, and assignments. The general rule is the length of make-up opportunity is equivalent to the length of the absence. Students are expected to make-up class work, tests, and assignments missed due to unexcused absences or tardies.</P>
<P>Students in grades K-5 will be given eighty percent (80%) credit for make-up class work, tests and assignments completed for unexcused absences except for the reason of suspension. For this reason students will receive no credit.</P>
<P>Students in grades 6-8 will be given fifty percent (50%) credit for make-up class work, tests and assignments completed for unexcused absences except for the reason of suspension. For this reason students will receive no credit.</P>
<P>Students in grades 9-12 will be given no credit for make-up class work, tests and assignments completed for any unexcused absence.</P>
<B><P>Tardy to Class</P></B>
<P>Each building implements procedures defining class tardies and appropriate disciplinary steps for being tardy to class.</P>
<B><P>Students Receiving Post-Secondary Credit</P></B>
<P>Some District students may be enrolled in post-secondary institutions to enable them to earn college and high school graduation credit through the successful completion of college courses. Students participating in post-secondary education options are expected and required to attend their classes at the post-secondary institutions just as they would be required to attend High School at the District.</P>
<P>Truancy Policy</P>
<B><P>Truancy Defined</P></B>
<P>Truancy is defined by R.C. 3313.609, as "any absence that is not excused".</P>
<B><P>Consequences of Truancy</P></B>
<P>Besides school-imposed discipline, unexcused absences (truancies) may be handled as follows:</P>
<P>A.</P><P>two (2) unexcused absences<BR></<P>
<P>Formal warning via letter to parent/student.</P>
<P>B.</P><P>five (5) unexcused absences<BR></<P>
<P>Juvenile Court truancy intervention meeting.</P>
<P>C.</P><P>seven (7) unexcused absences<BR></<P>
<P>Unofficial court hearing.</P>
<B><P>Important Note:</B> Formal court proceedings may be initiated without utilizing the above sequence.</P>
<B><P>Truancy Charges Filed in Court</P></B>
<P>Truancy charges may be filed against students who become chronic (or habitual) truants. In addition, "contributing" charges may be filed against the parent(s).</P>
<P>A.</P><P>Chronic Truancy (Delinquency)</P>
<P>1.</P><P>seven (7) consecutive unexcused absences </P>
<P>2.</P><P>ten (10) unexcused absences in four (4) weeks </P>
<P>3.</P><P>fifteen (15) unexcused absences in a school year </P>
<P>B.</P><P>Habitual Truancy (Unruly) </P>
<P>1.</P><P>five (5) consecutive unexcused absences </P>
<P>2.</P><P>seven (7) unexcused absences in four (4) weeks </P>
<P>3.</P><P>twelve (12) unexcused absences in a school year </P>
<P>Students admitting to the truancy charge or adjudicated as unruly/delinquent for truancy may be ordered by the Juvenile Court to return to school and accumulate no further unexcused absences or tardies until graduation. A violation of court order may be filed against the student for any future unexcused absence or tardy. The same applies to parents who have plead or been found guilty of "contributing" charges. Juvenile Court may retain jurisdiction of students until they attain twenty-one (21) years of age.</P>
<B><P>Athletics, Student Activities, Cheerleading, and Student Attendance</P></B>
<P>A student must be in school to participate in or attend a school function that evening. Only the principal may excuse a student for being absent from school and allow a student to participate in an event. The absence must be verified in advance and be for medical, dental, family death, legal, or school-related reasons. Continuous absences will result in removal from the activity and school discipline.</P>
<B><P>Passes for Leaving School</P></B>
<P>Students are not permitted to leave the school grounds at any time during the school day without a permit from the school office. If a student must leave the building because of illness or any other emergency, that student must get permission from designated school personnel. Parental permission to leave school must also be secured by school officials before a student may sign-out in the attendance office. Failure to follow the school building's proper procedure will be considered an unexcused absence.</P>
<P>A student may leave school before the day ends provided the parent/legal guardian writes a note indicating the student has a medical, dental, or legal appointment, or that an emergency exists. This note, with a telephone number or an appointment card, must be turned into the office before school begins. Most of these absences (including appointments to get driver's licenses) should only result in a partial or one half (1/2) day absence from school. Students will not be excused for the entire day unless it is verified by the specific appointment stating the need to be out all day. Elementary students must have a note indicating a change in the student's routine (a bus student being picked up or walking, rather than riding the bus).</P>
<P>There is no legal, acceptable reason for any student to miss school in the name of a "skip day," therefore, any student participating in such an unauthorized activity shall be deemed truant and will be dealt with according to the rules of truancy.</P>
