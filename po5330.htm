<H3>5330 - USE OF MEDICATIONS</H3>
<P>The Board of Education considers the diagnosis and treatment of student illnesses to be the direct responsibility of the parents. Parents are responsible to make every effort to avoid the necessity of administering medications or treatments during the school day or during supervised extracurricular activities. However, if it is necessary for the critical health of students to receive medications or treatments during school hours or extracurricular activities, parents and students are expected to comply with rules and procedures established by the Board of Education. Disabled students, who require medication to benefit from his/her educational program, and their parents are also expected to comply with rules and procedures established by the Board of Education. A copy of the parent's written request and authorization and the prescriber's written statement must be given, by the next school day following the District's receipt of the documents, to the person authorized to administer drugs to the student for whom the authorization and statement have been received.</P>
<P>Additionally, students shall be permitted to carry and use, as necessary, an epinephrine autoinjector to treat anaphylaxis, provided the student has prior written approval from the prescriber of the medication and his/her parent/guardian, if the student is a minor, and has submitted written approval (Form 5330 F4, Authorization for the Possession and Use of Epinephrine Autoinjector (epi-pen)) to the principal and any school nurse assigned to the building. The parent/guardian or the student shall provide a back-up dose of the medication to the principal or school nurse. This permission shall extend to any activity, event, or program sponsored by the school or in which the school participates. In the event epinephrine is administered by the student or a school employee at school or at any of the covered events, a school employee shall immediately request assistance from an emergency medical service provider (911).</P>
<P>Medications in this policy will be referred to as prescription medication or over-the-counter (OTC medication). "Treatment" refers both to the manner in which a medication is administered and to health-care procedures which require special training, such as catheterization or tube feeding.</P>
<P>Students in grade K-12 who require medications and/or medically prescribed treatment during the school day shall follow these procedures:</P>
<P>A. The school nurse or an appropriate person designated by the building principal will supervise the secure and proper storage and dispensing of medications. The school nurse will be responsible for training school personnel in medication administration.</P>
<P>B. Prescription medications must be received in the container in which it was dispensed by the licensed prescriber or licensed pharmacist and labeled with the student's name, name of medication and strength, dose of medication and times and intervals of administration. The parent or guardian is responsible to bring prescription medication to the appropriate school personnel. Prescribed medication must be administered in the presence of appropriate school personnel. Prescription medication that is regulated as a controlled substance will be counted by school personnel and parent/guardian when it is received.</P>
<P>C. Request to Administer Medications or other Medical Procedures form must accompany prescription medication and be completed by the licensed prescriber and the parent/guardian. This form can be found on the school website under school health services and follows guidelines set forth in the Ohio revised code.</P>
<P>D. For grades K-6 OTC medications must be brought to school by the parent/guardian accompanied by the Request to Administer Medications form that is signed by the parent. The medication must be in the original container. The school nurse/clinic nurse has the authority and responsibility to reject a parent's request and to decline to administer an OTC medication if the nurse believes that such medication is unnecessary, inappropriate, or could lead to harm.<BR><P>
<P>For grades 7-12 OTC medications may be carried by the student and the responsibility for administration of those medications rests solely with the parent and student. The OTC medication must be in the original container and be accompanied by a note from the parent. At no time is a student to sell or give OTC medications to another person. This will result in appropriate disciplinary action as outlined in the Board Substance Abuse policy and the Student Code of Conduct.<BR><P>
<P>Students will be allowed to carry medications deemed necessary by the licensed prescriber, for severe life threatening conditions, if the student has the Request to Administer Medications or other Medical Procedures form on file. These medications must also be labeled appropriately.</P>
<P>E. The parent, guardian or other person having care or charge of the student shall submit to the school nurse or principal a revised statement signed by the licensed prescriber who prescribed the medication if any of the information provided by the licensed prescriber as described above changes.</P>
<P>F. A new Request to Administer Medications or other Medical Procedures form must be submitted at the beginning of each school year, for each new prescription and OTC medication for grades K-6. If a student will be attending a school sponsored overnight activity, the form submitted must include twenty-four (24) hour dosing guidelines.</P>
<P>G. The school nurse or building principal shall establish a location in the school building for the storage of all medications to be administered. All medications shall be stored in a locked storage place. Medications that require refrigeration shall be kept in a refrigerator in a place not commonly used by students.</P>
<P>H. No person who has been authorized by this policy to administer a medication and who has a copy of the most recent licensed prescriber's statement which has been given to him/her prior to administering the medication shall be liable in civil damages for administering or failing to administer the medication unless such person acts in a manner that constitutes gross negligence or wanton or reckless misconduct.</P>
<P>I. A record of dosage administered to the student by the authorized person in the school shall be kept for the duration of the prescription.</P>
<P>J. Medication remaining at the end of each school year must be picked up by the parent/guardian within one (1) week of the end of the school year or it will be discarded.</P>
