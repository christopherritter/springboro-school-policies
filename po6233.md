{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes the value in providing meals,
refreshments, and/or other amenities for staff, students, citizens,
advisory groups who participate in meetings and staff development
sessions, or on other occasions as deemed appropriate by the
administration.

The Board hereby affirms that these expenses do serve a valid and proper
public purpose. The Board believes that the "public purpose" served is
the promotion of education, enhancement of morale, and rapport, and the
encouragement of participation in said activities. However, under no
circumstances shall public funds be expended for the purchase of
alcoholic beverages.

The Board further directs the Treasurer to include funds in the annual
appropriations for the purchase of such amenities or to reimburse staff
who incur such expenses if purchased in connection with meetings, staff
development sessions, or other occasions deemed appropriate by the
administration.
