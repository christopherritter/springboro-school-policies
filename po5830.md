================

The Board of Education acknowledges that the solicitation of funds by
student organizations from students must be limited since compulsory
attendance laws make the student a captive donor and since such
solicitation may disrupt the program of the schools.

For purposes of this policy, "student fund raising" shall include the
solicitation and collection of money for any purpose and shall include
the collection of money in exchange for tickets, papers, or any other
goods or services for approved student activities.

Fund raising by approved school organizations, those whose funds are
managed by the Treasurer, may be permitted in school by the principal.
Collections of money by approved school organizations off school grounds
may be permitted by the Superintendent.

Fund raising by students on behalf of organizations whose funds are not
managed by the Treasurer may be permitted on school grounds by the
Superintendent.

The Superintendent shall establish administrative guidelines for the
solicitation of funds which shall:

A. specify the times and places in which funds may be collected;

B. describe permitted methods of solicitation which do not place undue
pressure on students;

C. limit the kind and amount of advertising for solicitation.

The Superintendent shall distribute this policy and the rules which
implement it to each student organization granted permission to solicit
funds.
