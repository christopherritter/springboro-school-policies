<H3>0167.1 - Use of Electronic Mail</H3>
<P>Since E-mail is a form of communication that could conflict with the Sunshine Law, it will be used only for the purposes of communicating messages between Board members or between a Board member and employee(s) which do not involve deliberating or rendering a decision on matters pending before the Board.</P>
<P>Under no circumstances shall Board members use E-mail to discuss among themselves Board business that is only to be discussed in an open meeting of the Board, is part of an executive session, or could be considered an invasion of privacy if the message were to be monitored by another party.</P>
<P>There should be no expectation of privacy for any messages sent by E-mail. Messages that have been deleted may still be accessible on the hard drive, if the space has not been occupied by other messages. Messages, deleted or otherwise, may be subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act, unless an exemption would apply.</P>

<P>Revised 6/28/05</P>
<H3>0169.1 - Public Participation at Board Meetings</H3>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes the value to school governance of resident and employee comment on educational issues and the importance of encouraging members of the employees and residents to express themselves on school matters of community interest.</P>
<P>Consistent with Board Policy 0165.1, item number C.3.5., there shall be a period of public participation at the beginning of the meeting set aside for residents and employees who wish to make a presentation to the Board on a prearranged basis. A maximum of thirty (30) minutes of resident and employee participation will be permitted at that time, unless a longer period is agreed upon by the Board. The Board President shall have the authority to limit the speaking time per person to a maximum of five (5) minutes or less. Requests for a speaking time during this period shall be made to the Superintendent at least three (3) days prior to the meeting. This requirement may be waived by the President or the Superintendent at their discretion.</P>
<P>Consistent with Board Policy 0165.1, item number C.3.5., citizens may also be recognized by the President to present their opinions, comments, and related information. All such participation must be related to the Board work session agenda items at the Board meeting. The speaking time of individuals may be restricted by the President to the extent necessary to hear the widest range of views, avoid redundancy, and assure that the agenda is completed by a reasonable hour.</P>
<P>The following procedure shall be in effect whenever large delegations of residents or employees attend a Board meeting requesting to be heard on an issue being considered or discussed:</P>
<P>A. Statement of Board Position</P>
<P>Following discussion of the subject by the Board, the Board President may briefly describe the situation and characterize the Board's position regarding it, if the Board has in fact taken a position. If no official action has been taken, the President may so state and may summarize briefly the alternatives available to the Board, and implications of each.</P><P>B. Board to Answer Questions</P>
<P>After the speakers for and against the issue have been heard, the President shall indicate that questions pertaining directly to the issue involved may be directed by the Board.</P><P>C. Action by the Board</P>
<P>Upon a ruling by the President to close the public discussion, the Board may proceed with its deliberations and take whatever action it deems advisable.</P>
<P>In the event that so much public input is anticipated that sufficient time is not available during a given Board meeting, the Board may elect to set a special single purpose meeting to hear public comment.</P>
<P>Participants must be recognized by the presiding officer and must preface their comments by an announcement of their name, address, and group affiliation if appropriate.</P>
<P>The presiding officer may:</P><P>A. interrupt, warn, or terminate a participant's statement when the statement is too lengthy, personally directed, abusive, obscene, or irrelevant;</P><P>B. request any individual to leave the meeting when that person does not observe reasonable decorum;</P><P>C. request the assistance of law enforcement officers in the removal of a disorderly person when that person's conduct interferes with the orderly progress of the meeting;</P><P>D. call for a recess or an adjournment to another time when the lack of public decorum so interferes with the orderly conduct of the meeting as to warrant such action;</P><P>E. waive these rules with the approval of the Board when necessary for the protection of privacy or the efficient administration of the Board's business.</P>
