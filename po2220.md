{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education shall provide a comprehensive instructional
program to serve the educational needs of the students of this District.
The Board shall periodically adopt courses of study that define the key
components of the District's curriculum and instruction.

No course of study shall be taught in the schools of this District
unless the Board adopted it. The Board shall determine which units of
the instructional program constitute courses of study and are thereby
subject to the adoption procedures of the Board.

The Superintendent or his/her designee shall recommend to the Board such
courses of study as are deemed to be in the best interest of the
students. Each course of study shall:

A. align with the District's mission, philosophy, educational goals, and
strategic plan;

B. identify learning and performance expectations;

C. provide a scope and sequence of knowledge and skills to be learned;

D. prescribe methods for assessment of student progress;

E. be guided by Ohio's State-adopted academic content standards.

Each course of study is intended to provide a basic framework for
instruction and learning. Within this framework, each teacher shall use
the course of study in a manner best designed to meet the needs of the
students for whom s/he is responsible. Deviation from its content must
be approved by the Superintendent or his/her designee.

The Superintendent or his/her designee shall maintain a current list of
all courses of study offered by this District.

The list shall include a description of each course of study and its
date of adoption.
