5640 - PHYSICAL RESTRAINT OF STUDENTS
=====================================

Certificated staff as well as non-certificated staff may, within the
scope of their employment, use and apply reasonable force and restraint
to quell a disturbance which threatens to cause physical injury to
others, to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects upon
or within control of student, in self-defense, or for protection of
persons or property.

It should be particularly noted that use of force must be "reasonable"
and "necessary" when undertaken in a good-faith attempt to carry out the
responsibilities of the employee's position.

When the employee inflicts unnecessary, unreasonable, irrational, or
inappropriate force upon a student, s/he is subject to discipline by the
Board.
