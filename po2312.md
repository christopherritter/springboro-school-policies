2312 - MINIMUM CLASS ENROLLMENT
===============================

A course must have at least fifteen (15) students registered for the
course before it is included in the master schedule. Exceptions to this
number are for special education classes, independent study assignments,
or correspondence classes.

The second year and each succeeding year of a sequential course must
have at least ten (10) students registered for the course before it is
included in the master schedule. (This requirement does not preclude the
administration from establishing independent study assignments.)

When a course is not included in the master schedule because of
enrollment below minimum, it will be offered on alternate years before a
decision is made to eventually remove it from the curriculum.

Exceptions to the above may be made with the approval of the
Superintendent or his/her designee.
