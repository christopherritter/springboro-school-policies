<BODY><B><P>5130 - WITHDRAWAL FROM SCHOOL</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education affirms that, while statute requires attendance of each student until eighteen (18) years of age, it is in the best interests of both students and the community that they complete the educational program that will equip them with skills and increase their chances for a successful and fulfilling life beyond the schools.</P>
<P>The Board directs that whenever a student wishes to withdraw, effort should be made to determine the underlying reason for such action and the resources of the District should be used to assist the student in reaching his/her career goals. No student between the age of sixteen (16) and eighteen (18) will be permitted to withdraw without a fully executed age and schooling certificate (work permit) and the written consent of a parent/guardian.</P>
<P>Whenever a student under the age of eighteen (18), withdraws from school without moving out of state, transferring to another approved school, or enrolling in and attending an approved program, the Superintendent shall notify the Registrar of Motor Vehicles and the Judge of the Juvenile Court. See Policy <A HREF='po5200.htm'><B>5200</B></A> on Attendance.</P>
<P>Such notification is to be given within two (2) weeks after the Superintendent confirms the student is not properly enrolled in and attending another approved school or program or has moved out-of-state.</P>
<P>In accordance with Policy <A HREF='po5610.htm'><B>5610</B></A>, the Superintendent shall initiate expulsion proceedings against a student who has committed an act that warrants expulsion under Board policy even if the student withdraws from school prior to the hearing or decision to impose the expulsion. Any resulting expulsion shall be imposed for the same duration it would have been had the student remained enrolled.</P>
