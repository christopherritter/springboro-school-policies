5341 - EMERGENCY MEDICAL AUTHORIZATION
======================================

The District will distribute annually to parents or guardians of all
students the Emergency Medical Authorization Form. In the event
emergency medical treatment for a student is necessary, the District
will adhere to the instructions on the authorization form.

The Emergency Medical Authorization Form will be kept in a separate,
easily accessible file in each school building during the school year.

Any time a student or group of students is taken out of the District to
participate in a school event, the staff in charge of the event must
take the Emergency Medical Forms for those students. This includes, and
is not limited to, students involved in music trips, athletic trips,
field trips, and academic contests. This does not include student
spectators at events.
