5722 - SCHOOL SPONSORED PUBLICATIONS
====================================

The Board of Education may sponsor student publications as a means for
students to learn, under adult direction, the rights and
responsibilities of the press in a free society.

Such publications also play a vital role in the school program by:

A. interpreting students and the school to the community;

B. serving as a public relations media;

C. developing skills in communicating via the mass media;

D. developing acceptable methods for preserving the constitutional
provision of free speech.

In sponsoring a student publication, the Board is mindful of the fact
that the publication could be available to any student attending this
school, and must, therefore, be generally suitable for all students.

Issues on which opposing points of view have been promulgated by
responsible opinion may be introduced in a school sponsored publication
provided both sides of the issue are given equal opportunity to present
their views and provided further that the material is generally
acceptable to this community.

Materials which violate or may violate the rights of others may not be
published. A listing of such material is given in the Board's policy for
"Student Sponsored Publications."

The decision on publication shall be made by the advisor with appeal to
the principal and Superintendent.
