===================

The Board of Education realizes the concern of its employees for the
availability of those protective and personally advantageous benefits
beyond an individual's basic salary. It is the Board's desire to make
available within limits of law and Board fiscal management the
opportunity for payroll deduction of annuities according to the
following:

A. There shall not be a limit to the number of companies that represent
the employees of the school system. However, there must be at least five
(5) employees that are participating in the tax-sheltered annuity
program offered by any one company.

B. The minimum amount to be withheld from each paycheck shall be twenty
dollars (\$20.00).

C. Withholding for annuities shall begin with the first check of the
month following receipt of the completed salary reduction agreement.
