<H1>2279 - CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN THE SCHOOLS</H1>
<P>Educating students for responsible citizenship is a role of public schools. Significant components of responsible citizenship in this District shall include, but not be restricted to, a knowledge of:</P>
<P>A. the history of the United States of America;</P>
<P>B. the democratic principles of freedom, justice, and equality;</P>
<P>C. the development of our democratic form of government;</P>
<P>D. the necessity of citizen participation in political process to maintain a democratic form of government;</P>
<P>E. our heritage - including customs, traditions, rituals, and symbols of allegiance to our country (including accepted etiquette);</P>
<P>F. the USA's responsibilities in a global society.</P>
<P>This knowledge shall be reinforced by appropriate ceremonies and observances which aid students in the development of their interpretations of patriotism and citizenship.</P>
<P>The flag of the United States shall be raised above each school and/or at other appropriate places during all school sessions, weather permitting. The flag shall be raised before the opening of school and taken down at its close every day.</P>
<P>The opportunity to participate in patriotic ceremonies, including recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, shall occur on a regular basis for all students. However, no student shall be compelled to participate in the reciting of the Pledge. The Superintendent shall develop administrative guidelines which ensure that those who conduct this activity do it at an appropriate time, in an appropriate manner, and with due regard to the need to protect the rights and the privacy of a non-participating student.</P>
