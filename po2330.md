2330 - HOMEWORK
===============

The Board of Education acknowledges the educational validity of
out-of-school assignments as adjuncts to and extensions of the
instructional program of the schools.

"Homework" shall refer to those assignments to be prepared by the
student outside of the school or independently while attending school.

Assignment of homework shall be according to these guidelines:

A. Homework should be a properly planned part of the curriculum,
extending and reinforcing the student's learning experience in the
school.

B. The number, frequency, and degree of difficulty of homework
assignments should be based on the ability and needs of the student and
take into account potential homework assignments from other classes and
other activities that have a legitimate claim on a student's time,
including the need for lessons and family activities.

C. The schools should recognize the role of parents by suggesting ways
in which parents may assist the school in helping a student carry out
assigned responsibilities.

D. Homework should always serve a valid learning purpose; it should
never be used as a punitive measure.
