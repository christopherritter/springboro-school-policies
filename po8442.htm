<H3>8442 - REPORTING ACCIDENTS</H3>
<P>Each Board of Education in Ohio pays assessments to the Worker's Compensation Fund. Any employee injured in the pursuit of school activities can draw compensation from this fund. The date, time, place, and nature of injury must be reported in writing to the Office of the Superintendent within forty-eight (48) hours of the date of occurrence. Application for this compensation must be filed by the physician not later than two (2) weeks after the date of first treatment, if it is to be recognized.</P>
<P>If a staff member sustains a workplace injury while s/he is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance not prescribed by his/her physician, s/he may be disqualified for compensation and benefits under the Workers Compensation Act. If the staff member tests positive or refuses to submit to a test for alcohol and/or other drugs after sustaining a workplace injury, the employee may dispute or prove untrue the presumption or belief that alcohol and/or other drugs are the proximate cause of the injury (i.e., rebuttable presumption).</P>
