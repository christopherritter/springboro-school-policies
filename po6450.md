================

The Board of Education recognizes its position as a major purchaser in
this community, and while it is the intention of the Board to purchase
materials and supplies of quality at the lowest possible cost through
widespread competition, if all other considerations are equal, the Board
prefers to purchase within the District from established local
merchants.
