<P>The Springboro Community City School District shall waive fees assessed by the District for instructional materials only for students whose parent(s) or guardian are unable to afford them. The Superintendent may, as deemed necessary, establish additional procedures to supplement the procedures established in this policy regarding the requests for the waiver of fees. This waiver does not include District fees associated with extra-curricular activities or student enrichment programs that are not part of a course of instruction.</P>

<P>Students eligible for a waiver of school fees include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>

<H3>Notification to Parents</H3>
<P>A. Annually the substance of this policy shall be communicated in writing to the parent(s) or guardian of all students in the District.</P>
<P>B. The first bill or notice sent to parents or guardians who owe fees shall state:</P>
<P>1. The District will waive fees for persons unable to afford them in accordance with its policy</P>
<P>2. The procedure for applying for a fee waiver, and the name, address and telephone number of the person to contact for information concerning a fee waiver.</P>
<H3>Procedures for Resolution of Disputes</H3>
<P>A. A parent(s) or guardian who cannot pay school fees may write a letter requesting a waiver of fees to the Superintendent. The letter must contain the following:</P>
<P>1. name(s) of student(s)</P>
<P>2. name of parent(s) or guardian(s)</P>
<P>3. address of parent(s) or guardian(s)</P>
<P>4. phone number of parent(s) or guardian(s)</P>
<P>5. school where child(ren) attend(s)</P>
<P>6. reason for request for waiver of fees</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall have the authority to review the waiver request and request such further information, if any, as s/he deems necessary in order to make a decision on that request.</P>
<P>B. No fee shall be collected from any parent(s) or guardian who is seeking a fee waiver in accordance with the District's policy until the District has acted on the initial request or appeal (if any is made), and the parent(s) or guardian have been notified of the decision.</P>
<P>C. If the Superintendent or designee denies a request for fee waiver, then a copy of the decision shall be mailed to the parent(s) or guardian within fifteen (15) school days of receipt of the request. The decision shall state the reason for the denial and shall inform the parent(s) or guardian of the right to appeal, including the process and timelines for that action. The denial notice shall also include a statement informing the parent(s) or guardian that reapplication may be made for a waiver any time during the school year, if circumstances change. The decision of the Superintendent or designee is final.</P>
<H3>Nondiscrimination</H3>
<P>The Board expects all staff members to exercise the utmost care to see that, as a result of their actions or comments, students cannot differentiate between those students whose parents are unable to purchase required instructional materials or pay required fees and those whose parents can.</P>
