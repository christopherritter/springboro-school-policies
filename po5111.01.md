{{ page.title }}
================

Children who meet the Federal definition of "homeless" will be provided
a free and appropriate public education in the same manner as all other
students of the District and will not be stigmatized or segregated on
the basis of their status as homeless. No homeless student will be
denied enrollment based on a lack of proof of residency. No Board
policy, administrative guideline, or practice will be interpreted or
applied in such a way as to inhibit the enrollment, attendance, or
school success of homeless children.

Homeless students will be provided services comparable to other students
in the District including:

A. transportation services;

B. educational services for which the homeless student meets eligibility
criteria including services provided under Title I of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act or similar State and local programs, educational
programs for children with disabilities, and educational programs for
students with limited English proficiency;

C. programs in vocational and technical education;

D. programs for gifted and talented students; and

E. school nutrition programs.

The Superintendent will appoint a Liaison for Homeless Children who will
perform the duties as assigned by the Superintendent. Additionally, the
Liaison will coordinate and collaborate with the State Coordinator for
the Education of Homeless Children and Youth as well as with community
and school personnel responsible for the provision of education and
related services to homeless children and youths.
