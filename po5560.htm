<B><P>5560 - DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education believes that the students of this District are entitled to an education free from undue disruption. Students who willfully disrupt the educational program shall be subject to the discipline procedures of this District. Every reasonable effort shall be made to determine and remediate the cause or causes of a chronically disruptive student's unacceptable conduct.</P>
<P>Disruptive students in the secondary grades will be disciplined in accordance with Board policy on suspension and expulsion. Disruptive students in the elementary grades will be reported to the building principal, who may discipline the student in accordance with Board policy on student discipline. A student who continually and willfully disobeys persons in authority and violates school rules shall be reviewed to determine the cause of his/her unacceptable conduct, assess his/her educational needs, and, if appropriate, plan an instructional program to meet those needs.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall report regularly to the Board the incidence of acts of violence and vandalism in the School District and shall prepare a remedial plan whenever the report shows a significant increase in the number of such acts.</P>
