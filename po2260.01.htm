<H3>2260.01 - SECTION 504/ADA PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION BASED ON DISABILITY</H3>
<P>Pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its implementing regulations ("Section 504"), no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall, solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. The Board of Education does not discriminate in admission or access to, participation or treatment, or employment in, its programs or activities. As such, the Board's policies and practices will not discriminate against employees and students with disabilities, will provide equal opportunity for employment, and will make accessible to qualified individuals with disabilities its facilities, programs, and activities. No discrimination will be knowingly permitted against any individual with a disability on the sole basis of that disability in any of the programs, activities, policies, and/or practices in the District.</P>
<P>As used in this policy and the implementing administrative guidelines, "an individual with a disability" means a person who has, has a record of, or is regarded as having, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Major life activities are functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.</P>
<P>Major life activities also include the operation of a major bodily function, including, but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.</P>
<P>An impairment that is episodic in nature or in remission is considered a disability if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.</P>
<P>The determination of whether an impairment substantially interferes with a major life activity must be made without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures such as medication, medical supplies, equipment or appliances, low-vision devices (not including ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses), prosthetics (including limbs and devices), hearing aids and cochlear implants or other implantable hearing devices, mobility devices, oxygen therapy equipment or supplies, assistive technology, reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids or services, or learned behavior or adaptive neurological modifications.</P>
<P>With respect to employment, a qualified person with a disability means a disabled person who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in question.</P>
<P>With respect to public preschool, elementary and secondary educational services, a qualified person with a disability means a disabled person:</P>
<P>A. who is of an age during which nondisabled persons are provided educational services;</P>
<P>B. who is of any age during which it is mandatory under Ohio law to provide educational services to disabled persons; or</P>
<P>C. to whom the State is required to provide a free appropriate public education pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA).</P>
<P>With respect to vocational education services, a qualified person with a disability means a disabled person who meets the academic and technical standards requisite to admission or participation in the vocational program or activity.</P>
<P>The Director of Special Education is the District Section 504 Compliance Officer/ADA Coordinator ("District Compliance Officer"). The District Compliance Officer is responsible for coordinating the District's efforts to comply with and fulfill its responsibilities under Section 504 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). A copy of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, including copies of their implementing regulations, may be obtained from the District Compliance Officer. The District Compliance Officer can be reached at:</P>
<P>1685 S. Main Street</P>
<P>Springboro, OH 45066</P>
<P>(937) 748-3960</P>
<P>The District Compliance Officer will oversee the investigation of any complaints of discrimination based on disability, which may be filed pursuant to the Board's adopted internal complaint procedure, and will attempt to resolve such complaints.</P>
<P>The District Compliance Officer will also oversee the training of employees in the District so that all employees understand their rights and responsibilities under Section 504 and the ADA, and are informed of the Board's policies, administrative guidelines and practices with respect to fully implementing and complying with the requirements of Section 504/ADA.</P>
<H3>Employment Practices</P>
<P>Discrimination Prohibited</H3>
<P>In accordance with Section 504/ADA, no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any of the District's programs or activities. Further, the Board will take positive steps to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. The Board will not limit, segregate or classify applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of disability. Additionally, the Board will not participate in any contractual or other relationships that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities who are applicants or employees to discrimination on the basis of disability.</P>
<H3>Reasonable Accommodation</H3>
<P>The Board will make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the District's program and/or activities.</P>
<H3>Facilities</H3>
<P>No qualified person with a disability will, because the District's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by persons with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which Section 504/ADA applies.</P>
<P>For facilities constructed or altered after June 3, 1977, the District will comply with applicable accessibility standards. For those existing facilities constructed prior to June 3, 1977, the District is committed to operating its programs and activities so that they are readily accessible to persons with disabilities. This includes, but is not limited to, providing accommodations to parents with disabilities who desire access to their child's educational program or meetings pertinent thereto. Programs and activities will be designed and scheduled so that the location and nature of the facility or area will not deny a student with a disability the opportunity to participate on the same basis as students without disabilities. The District will meet its obligation through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, alteration of existing facilities and/or construction of new facilities, or any other method that results in making its programs and activities accessible to persons with disabilities. In choosing among available methods for meeting its obligations, the District will give priority to those methods that serve persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
<H3>Education</H3>
<P>The Board is committed to identifying, evaluating, and providing a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to students within its jurisdiction who are disabled within the definition of Section 504, regardless of the nature or severity of their disabilities.</P>
<P>If a student has a physical or mental impairment that significantly limits one or more major life activities, the Board will provide the student with a free appropriate public education. An appropriate education, may include regular or special education and related aids and services to accommodate the unique needs of students with disabilities. For disabled students who are not eligible for specially designed instruction under IDEIA, the related aids and services (including accommodations/modifications/interventions) they need in order to have their needs met as adequately as the needs of nondisabled students are met, shall be delineated, along with their placement, in a Section 504 Plan (Form 2260.01A F13).</P>
<P>Parent(s)/guardian(s)/custodian(s) ("parents") are invited and encouraged to participate fully in the evaluation process. If the parents disagree with the determination made by the District's professional staff, they may file an internal complaint, request a hearing with an impartial hearing officer, or file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights.</P>
<P>The Board is committed to educating (or providing for the education of) each qualified person with a disability who resides within the District with persons who are not disabled to the maximum extent appropriate. Generally, the District will place a person with a disability in the regular educational environment unless it is demonstrated that the education of the person in the regular environment even with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. If the District places a person in a setting other than the regular educational environment, it shall take into account the proximity of the alternate setting to the person's home.</P>
<P>The District will provide non-academic extracurricular services and activities in such a manner as is necessary to afford qualified persons with disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in such services and activities. Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may include counseling services, physical recreational athletics, transportation, health services, recreational activities, special interests groups or clubs sponsored by the District, referrals to agencies that provide assistance to persons with disabilities, and employment of students. In providing or arranging for the provision of meals and recess periods, and nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, including those listed above, the District will verify that persons with disabilities participate with persons without disabilities in such activities and services to the maximum extent appropriate.</P>
<P>Notice of the Board's policy on nondiscrimination in employment and education practices and the identity of the District's Compliance Officer(s) will be posted throughout the District, and published in the District's recruitment statements or general information publications.</P>
<P>The Board directs the Superintendent to prepare administrative guidelines for facilitating the prompt, fair and appropriate identification, referral, evaluation and placement of students with disabilities in accordance with Section 504.</P>
<P>The Board will provide in-service training and consultation to staff on the education of persons with disabilities, as necessary and appropriate.</P>
<P>The Board will utilize a system of procedural safeguards that will provide for prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging violations of Section 504/ADA. Due process rights of students with disabilities and their parents under Section 504 will be enforced.</P>
