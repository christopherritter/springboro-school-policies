<H1>9210 - DISTRICT-SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS</H1>
<H3>Relations With Parent Organizations</H3>
<P>The Board of Education supports all organizations of parents whose objectives are to promote the educational experiences of District students. However, in using the name of the District or its schools and in organizing a group whose identity derives from a school(s) of the District, parental organizations share responsibility with the Board for the welfare of participating students.</P>
<P>Parent organizations desiring to use the name or office of the District to organize students must obtain the approval of the Board as a prerequisite.</P>
<P>Each parent and/or support organization must obtain the approval of the Board as a prerequisite to organizing, and shall work within the appropriate school setting and in cooperation with the principal and other staff members and shall abide by the policies of the Board. Each group will submit its bylaws to the Superintendent or designee.</P>
<P>The Board shall offer the opportunity for any authorized school support entity to receive coverage under the District's liability insurance program to protect the entity against claims resulting from any act or omission of any school-support entity. The entity shall pay for such coverage as invoiced by the Treasurer.</P>
<P>Principals and staff members need to work closely with the officers of all parent organizations to enhance the educational opportunities for students. The activities must be integrated and balanced in accordance with the total District educational program and District goals and objectives must comply with all State and local laws and regulations.</P>
<P>Parent organizations that wish to construct anything on school property must have the permission of the Board in advance of the construction project. The organization must provide the Board, in writing, proof of financial stability and that funds are available for the construction project.</P>
<P>Parent organizations may be required to submit financial records of their activities in such detail as may be requested by the Superintendent.</P>
<H3>Relations With Booster Organizations</H3>
<P>The Board recognizes that the endeavors and objectives of booster organizations can be a valuable means of stimulating interest and endorsement of the aims and achievements of the District.</P>
<P>Booster organizations must submit, in a timely fashion, to the Superintendent/designee; if requested; their tentative goals and objectives along with their fund-raising plans for the next school year for review. Should the goals and objectives or fund-raising plans change after said request is made, the Superintendent/designee is to be advised before any final revisions are made.</P>
<P>Booster organizations must abide by all District policies and rules as well as the following list.</P>
<P>A. Booster organizations should not use the school's tax ID number.</P>
<P>B. Booster organizations should not accept checks made out to the school and vice versa.</P>
<P>C. District employees (administrators, exempt staff, and union members) shall not have a leadership role in booster organizations.</P>
<P>D. Fund-raising activities should not occur on school premises or during school hours unless permission has been given by the Superintendent/designee.</P>
<P>E. Documentation on ownership of property and fund-raising activities is required.</P>
<P>F. The use of the District name and emblems must be authorized.</P>
<P>G. Booster organizations must submit their bylaws to the Superintendent at his/her request for review. Reports on income, expenses, and balance sheets in such detail as requested by the Superintendent and/or the Treasurer/CFO.</P>
<P>The Board relies upon approved organizations to operate in a manner consistent with public expectations for the schools and reserves the right to withdraw approval from organizations which violate the bounds of community taste. Care must be taken to avoid compromising or diluting the responsibility and authority of the Board.</P>
