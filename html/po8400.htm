<BODY>
<H1>8400 - SCHOOL SAFETY</H1>
<P>The Board of Education is committed to maintaining a safe and drug-free environment in all of the District's schools. The Board believes that school crime and violence are multifaceted problems that need to be addressed in a manner that utilizes all available resources in the community through a coordinated effort of school district personnel, law enforcement agencies, and families. The Board further believes that school administrators and local law enforcement officials must work together to provide for the safety and welfare of students while they are at school or a school-related event or are on their way to and from school. The Board also believes that the first step in addressing school crime and violence is to assess the extent and nature of the problem(s), and then plan and implement strategies that promote school safety and minimize the likelihood of school crime and violence.</P>
<H3>School Safety Plan</H3>
<P>To that end, the Superintendent shall develop a School Safety Plan with input from representatives of the local law enforcement agencies; the local Fire Marshall(s) or his/her designee(s); representative(s) from emergency medical services; members of the Board; building administrators; representatives from the local emergency management service agency; School Resource Officer(s); parents; and staff.</P>
<P>The School Safety Plan shall be comprehensive and consider each school building under the Board's control. Thereafter, the Superintendent shall convene a meeting every three (3) years for the purpose of reviewing the School Safety Plan, and making modifications as deemed necessary and proper; identifying additional training that might be needed; and discussing any other such related matters as may be deemed to be necessary by the participants. The Superintendent shall also convene a meeting whenever a major modification to a school building requires changes in the procedures outlined in the School Safety Plan. Participants in this meeting shall include the Superintendent; representatives of the local law enforcement agencies; the local Fire Marshall(s) or his/her designee(s); representative(s) from emergency medical services; building administrators; parents; staff; the School Resource Officer and the School Nurse.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall make a report to the Board about this review and recommend the approval and adoption of any proposed revisions or additions to the <I>School Safety Plan.</P>
</I>
<P>Upon approval and adoption of the School Safety Plan by the Board, the Superintendent shall file a copy of such Plan and a blueprint of each building with the following:</P>
<P>A. each law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over the school building</P>
<P>B. upon request, the local fire department serving the area in which the school district is located; and</P>
<P>Additionally, the Superintendent shall file a copy of the School Safety Plan and a copy of each building floor plan with the Attorney General, who will post the information on the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway. If the Board revises the School Safety Plan, building blueprint or building floor plan, it shall file a copy of such revised document with the above-referenced entities within ninety-one (91) days of the Board's adoption of the revision.</P>
<P>Copies of the School Safety Plan and blueprints shall not be considered public records, however, building floor plans are subject to public disclosure.</P>
<P>The Board shall grant access to each school building to law enforcement personnel in order to enable such personnel to conduct training sessions for responding to threats and emergency events affecting the School District and/or a school building. Such access shall be provided outside of student instructional hours and an employee of the Board shall be present in the building during the training sessions.</P>
<P>Prior to the opening day of each school year, the Superintendent shall inform each enrolled student and the student's parent of the procedures to be used to notify parents in the event of an emergency or a serious threat to safety. Also, see Policy <A HREF='po8420.htm'><B>8420</B></A> - Emergency Situations at School.</P>
<H3>Safe and Drug Free Schools</H3>
<P>As a part of the School Safety Plan, the Board shall verify that it has procedures in place for keeping schools safe and drug-free that include (see also, Form 8330 F15 entitled Checklist of Policies and Guidelines Addressing No Child Left Behind Act of 2001):</P>
<P>A. appropriate and effective school discipline policies that prohibit disorderly conduct, the illegal possession of weapons and the illegal use, possession, distribution, and sale of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs by students;</P>
<P>B. security procedures at school and while students are on the way to and from school;</P>
<P>C. prevention activities that are designed to maintain safe, disciplined and drug-free environments;</P>
<P>D. a code of conduct or policy for all students that clearly states the responsibilities of students, teachers, and administrators in maintaining a classroom environment that:</P>
<P>1. allows a teacher to communicate effectively to all students in the class;</P>
<P>2. allows all students in the class the opportunity to learn;</P>
<P>3. has consequences that are fair, and developmentally appropriate;</P>
<P>4. considers the student and the circumstances of the situation; and</P>
<P>5. is enforced accordingly.</P>
<H3>Persistently Dangerous Schools</H3><P>The Board recognizes that State and Federal law requires that the District report annually incidents which meet the statutory definition of violent criminal offenses that occur in a school, on school grounds, on a school conveyance, or at a school-sponsored activity. It is further understood that the State Department of Education will then use this data to determine whether or not a school is considered &quot;persistently dangerous&quot; as defined by State policy.</P>
<P>Pursuant to the Board's stated intent to provide a safe school environment, the school administrators are expected to respond appropriately to any and all violations of the Student Code of Conduct, especially those of a serious, violent nature. In any year where the number of reportable incidents of violent criminal offenses in any school exceed the threshold number established in State policy, the Superintendent shall convene a meeting of the building administrator, representative(s) of the local law enforcement agencies, and any other individuals deemed appropriate for the purpose of developing a plan of corrective action that can be implemented in an effort to reduce the number of these incidents in the subsequent year.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall make a report to the Board about this plan of corrective action and shall recommend approval and adoption of it.</P>
<P>In the unexpected event that the number of reportable incidents in three (3) consecutive school years exceeds the statutory threshold and the school is identified as persistently dangerous, students attending the school shall have the choice option as provided in Policy 5113.02.</P>
<P>In addition, the Superintendent shall convene a meeting of the building administrator, representative(s) of the local law enforcement agencies, and any other individuals deemed appropriate for the purpose of developing a plan of corrective action that can be implemented in an effort to reduce the number of these incidents in the subsequent year.</P>
<H3>Victims of Violent Crime</H3>
<P>The Board further recognizes that, despite the diligent efforts of school administrators and staff to provide a safe school environment, an individual student may be a victim of a violent crime in a school, on school grounds, on a school conveyance, or at a school-sponsored activity. In accordance with Federal and State law the parents of the eligible student shall have the choice options provided by Policy 5113.02.</P>
