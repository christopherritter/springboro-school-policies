<H1>8600 - TRANSPORTATION</H1>
<P>It is the policy of the Board of Education to provide transportation for those students whose distance from their school makes this service necessary within the limitations established by State Law. Such laws and rules shall govern any question not covered by this policy.</P>
<P>School buses shall be purchased, housed, and maintained by the Board for the transportation of resident students between their home areas and the schools of the District to which they are assigned or to their nonpublic or community schools. The Superintendent may substitute smaller buses for reasons of economy or efficiency of operation.</P>
<P>The Superintendent may borrow, rent, or lease buses as their need arises.</P>
<P>Transportation of eligible vocational or special education children between their home areas and schools outside the District shall be arranged through the use of Board-owned vehicles, through cooperation with other districts, through commercial carriers, and/or by other means in the most efficient and economical manner.</P>
<P>Transportation to and from school shall be provided for each student residing in the District and attending a State-chartered nonpublic school that is located within the thirty (30) minute travel limitation established by State law on the same basis as established for resident students as set forth above. Chartered nonpublic school students who are transported by the Board may be assigned to ride on buses upon which resident students are also assigned.</P>
<P>Furthermore, transportation to and from school shall be provided for each student residing in the District and attending an approved community school. However, if that community school is located outside the District, transportation will only be provided consistent with the thirty (30) minute travel limitation established by State law. Students residing in the District and attending an approved community school located within the District will be provided transportation on the same basis as established for resident students set forth above. Students transported to an approved community school may be assigned to ride on buses upon which resident students are also assigned.</P>
<P>Transportation of eligible nonpublic or community school children between their homes areas and schools shall be arranged through the use of District-owned vehicles, through cooperation with other districts, through commercial carriers and/or by other means in the most efficient and economical manner. However, if the Board determines that said transportation is impractical, then the parents(s) shall be provided payment-in-lieu of transportation at the amount established by State law, unless otherwise directed by action of the State Board of Education.</P>
<P>Bus routes shall be established so that authorized bus stops will allow students from several homes within an area to meet at a central point for group pick-ups. Bus routes and stops shall be designed to consider the safe pick-up and transport of students. The Board shall approve the bus routes annually. The Superintendent or designee is authorized to make any necessary changes in the approved routes.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the installation and use of video recording devices in the school buses to assist the drivers in providing for the safety and well-being of the students while on a bus.</P>
<P>Students meeting the Federal definition of &quot;homeless&quot; will be transported from their temporary place of residence to their school of assignment, at the request of the parent, guardian or unaccompanied minor, to the same extent as all other students of the District and consistent with this Policy. If the homeless student's temporary residence is located outside the boundaries of the District, the Liaison for Homeless Children will coordinate with the Director of Transportation to contact the district in which the student temporarily resides to arrange for joint transportation of the student and to seek inter-district agreement on a method for apportioning the cost of such joint transportation. In no event will a homeless student be denied enrollment based on issues related to student transportation.</P>
