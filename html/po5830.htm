<H1>5830 - FUND RAISING</H1>
<P>The Board of Education acknowledges that the solicitation of funds by student organizations from students must be limited since compulsory attendance laws make the student a captive donor and since such solicitation may disrupt the program of the schools.</P>
<P>For purposes of this policy, "student fund raising" shall include the solicitation and collection of money for any purpose and shall include the collection of money in exchange for tickets, papers, or any other goods or services for approved student activities.</P>
<P>Fund raising by approved school organizations, those whose funds are managed by the Treasurer, may be permitted in school by the principal. Collections of money by approved school organizations off school grounds may be permitted by the Superintendent.</P>
<P>Fund raising by students on behalf of organizations whose funds are not managed by the Treasurer may be permitted on school grounds by the Superintendent.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall establish administrative guidelines for the solicitation of funds which shall:</P>
<P>A. specify the times and places in which funds may be collected;</P>
<P>B. describe permitted methods of solicitation which do not place undue pressure on students;</P>
<P>C. limit the kind and amount of advertising for solicitation.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall distribute this policy and the rules which implement it to each student organization granted permission to solicit funds.</P>
