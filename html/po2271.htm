<H1>2271 - POST SECONDARY ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS</H1>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes the value to students and to the District for students to participate in programs offered by accredited colleges and universities in Ohio.</P>
<P>The Board will approve participation by students in grades 9 through 12 or attending the Warren County Career Center who meet the State Board of Education's criteria, to enroll in approved post secondary programs while in attendance in the District. Students will be eligible to receive secondary credit for completing any of these programs. Such credit will count toward graduation requirements providing the course is free of charge or paid for by the parents of the student.</P>
<P>No student may participate, however, without the written consent of parents, if under the age of eighteen (18). Students must also participate in the counseling services offered in relation to this educational option, which must include information and counseling designed to make the student aware of the possible risks and benefits of the post secondary enrollment options program. Students in grades 8-11 must be provided with such information on or before March 1<SUP>st</SUP> in the year prior to enrollment in the program.</P>
<P>The District may deny high school credit for postsecondary courses any portion of which are taken during the period of a student's expulsion. If the student has elected to receive credit for course(s) toward fulfilling graduation requirements as well as postsecondary credit, that election is automatically revoked for all college courses in which the student is enrolled during the college term in which the expulsion is imposed.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall establish the necessary administrative guidelines to comply with State law which will thereafter be properly communicated to both students and their parents. The Superintendent shall also establish guidelines and procedures for the awarding of credit and the proper entry on a student's transcript and other records of his/her participation in a post secondary program.</P>
