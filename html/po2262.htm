<H1>2262 - LATCH-KEY PROGRAMS</H1>
<P>The Board of Education is concerned about the growing number of children who are receiving insufficient care, nurture, or supervision when not attending school. This has serious implications for their general well-being as well as for their ability to benefit from the school program to the extent they need or want to.</P>
<P>Since those children constitute a significant and growing portion of the student population, the Board shall seek to provide appropriate programs and services for these students, particularly in grades K through 5, by contracting for its facilities to be used by an outside organization specializing in latch-key programs.</P>
<P>No funds shall be expended for the program from the General Fund other than for:</P>
<P>A. facilities, if currently used for other purposes;</P>
<P>B. utilities furnished in conjunction with the program;</P>
<P>C. transportation by regular school buses.</P>
<P>The Superintendent shall establish administrative guidelines that will ensure that:</P>
<P>A. prior to the creation and approval of any latch-key program, parents and other members of the community are provided an opportunity to make recommendations on the operation and funding of the program;</P>
<P>B. programs and services are available to participating students both prior to the start of the regular school day and after school. The time periods should be scheduled so that a student may participate from the time s/he leaves a supervised environment until s/he may return to one;</P>
<P>C. the major emphasis is on providing educational programs and activities that help the students learn how to function more effectively as learners in the school setting while, at the same time, coping better with the out-of-school factors that are interfering with their educational program;</P>
<P>D. adequate attention is given to ensuring the students are being clothed and fed properly, exercising regularly, and learning how to maintain good physical and mental health;</P>
<P>E. any organization(s) contracted with to provide these programs has acquired adequate liability insurance and is maintaining appropriate adult-child ratios, providing quality child care, and, in general, complying with guidelines established by the State and the District;</P>
<P>F. parents are notified about the program and the procedures for enrollment;</P>
<P>G. there is continuing assessment of the effectiveness of the program by staff, participating parents, and other concerned members of the public.</P>
<P>R.C. 3313.207/208/209; 5104</P>
