<H1>7540.04 - STAFF NETWORK AND INTERNET ACCEPTABLE USE AND SAFETY</H1>
<P>Staff use of the District's computers, network and Internet services (&quot;Network&quot;) will be governed by this policy and the related administrative guidelines, and any applicable employment contracts and collective bargaining agreements. The due process rights of all users will be respected in the event there is a suspicion of inappropriate use of the Network. Users have no right or expectation to privacy when using the Network (including, but not limited to, privacy in the content of their personal files, e-mails, and records of their online activity while on the Network).</P>
<P>The Board encourages staff to utilize the Internet in order to promote educational excellence in our schools by providing them with the opportunity to develop the resource sharing, innovation, and communication skills and tools that are essential to both life and work. The Board encourages the faculty to develop the appropriate skills necessary to effectively access, analyze, evaluate, and utilize these resources in enriching educational activities. The instructional use of the Internet will be guided by the Board's policy on Instructional Materials.</P>
<P>Pursuant to Federal law, the Board has implemented technology protection measures, which protect against (e.g. filter or block) access to visual displays/depictions/materials that are obscene, constitute pornography, and/or are harmful to minors, as defined by the Children's Internet Protection Act. At the discretion of the Board or Superintendent, the technology protection measures may also be configured to protect against access to other material considered inappropriate for students to access. The Board also utilizes software and/or hardware to monitor online activity of staff members to restrict access to pornography and other material that is obscene, objectionable, inappropriate and/or harmful to minors. The technology protection measures, may not be disabled at any time that students may be using the Network, if such disabling will cease to protect against access to materials that are prohibited under the Children's Internet Protection Act. Any staff member who attempts to disable the technology protection measures without express written consent of an appropriate administrator will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. </P>
<P>The Superintendent or designee may temporarily or permanently unblock access to sites containing appropriate material, if access to such sites has been inappropriately blocked by the technology protection measures. The determination of whether material is appropriate or inappropriate shall be based on the content of the material and the intended use of the material, not on the protection actions of the technology protection measures. The Superintendent or designee may also disable the technology protection measures to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes.</P>
<P>Staff members will participate in professional development programs in accordance with the provisions of law, policy, and the collective bargaining agreement. Training shall include:</P>
<P>A. the safety and security of students while using e-mail, chat rooms, social media and other forms of direct electronic communications;</P>
<P>B. the inherent danger of students disclosing personally identifiable information online;</P>
<P>C. the consequences of unauthorized access (e.g., &quot;hacking&quot;), cyberbullying and other unlawful or inappropriate activities by students or staff online; and</P>
<P>D. unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of personal information regarding minors.</P>
<P>Furthermore, staff members shall provide instruction for their students regarding the appropriate use of technology and online safety and security as specified above, and staff members will monitor students' online activities while at school. Monitoring may include, but is not necessarily limited to, visual observations of online activities during class sessions; or use of specific monitoring tools to review browser history and network, server, and computer logs.</P>
<P>The disclosure of personally identifiable information about students online is prohibited.</P>
<P>The Superintendent or designee is responsible for providing training so that Internet users under their supervision are knowledgeable about this policy and accompanying guidelines. The Board expects that staff members will provide guidance and instruction to students in the appropriate use of the Internet. Such training shall include, but not be limited to, education concerning appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying awareness and response. All Internet users are required to sign a written agreement to abide by the terms and conditions of this policy and its accompanying guidelines.</P>
<P>Staff members are responsible for good behavior on Board's computers/network and the Internet just as they are in classrooms, school hallways, and other school premises and school sponsored events. Communications on the Internet are often public in nature. Staff members shall not access social media for personal use on the District's network, and shall access social media for educational use only after submitting a plan for that educational use and securing the principal's approval of that plan in advance. </P>
<P>General school rules for behavior and communication apply. The Board does not sanction any use of the Internet that is not authorized by or conducted strictly in compliance with this policy, its accompanying guidelines, and state and federal law. Users who disregard this policy and its accompanying guidelines or who commit any violation of the law may have their use privileges suspended or revoked, and additionally may have disciplinary action taken against them up to and including termination, as well as possible criminal prosecution. Users granted access to the Internet through the Board's computers assume all personal responsibility and liability, both civil and criminal, for uses of the Internet not authorized by this policy and its accompanying guidelines.</P>
<P>The Board designates the Superintendent and district administrators as the administrators responsible for initiating, implementing, and enforcing this policy and its accompanying guidelines as they apply to staff members' use of the Network.</P>
<H3>Social Media Use</H3>
<P>It is a staff member's decision whether or not to participate in social media. However, an employee's personal or private use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, blogs, etc., may have unintended consequences. While the Board respects its employee's First Amendment rights, those rights do not include permission to post comments that could compromise the District's mission or its educational interests, undermine staff relationships or reputations, negatively impact its students or the school community at large, or cause a substantial disruption to the school environment. Such activity, even if engaged in on an employee's own time using technology not owned by the Board, may result in discipline up to and including termination. Posting social media should be done in a manner sensitive to the staff member's professional responsibilities. Online behavior deemed unbecoming the teaching profession will be reported to the Office of Educator Conduct as a possible violation of the Code of Professional Conduct for Ohio Educators, and may result in suspension or revocation of a teaching license by the state. When an employee might be perceived online as an agent of the school district, the employee is expected to be clear that he/she is sharing views as an individual and not as a representative of the school district.</P>
<P>Network administrators, by the nature of their work, have privileges and responsibilities that other users of technology generally do not have. District Administrators must therefore adhere to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct in the use of and administration of school district resources. Network Administrators are expected to comply with additional guidelines as approved by the Board.</P>
