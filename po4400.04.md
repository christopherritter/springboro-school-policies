4400.04 - SUBSTITUTE PAY
========================

In order to ensure reliable assistance in the absence of regular
noncertificated personnel, the Board of Education will offer competitive
compensation to qualified substitutes.

Noncertificated substitutes will be paid on a per diem basis at a rate
of pay for the job on which they are substituting as established by the
Board.

If a regular employee substitutes in another classification, s/he will
be paid according to the rate for the substitute position.

A substitute noncertificated employee who has served for ten (10) or
more years as a noncertificated employee in the Springboro Community
City School District shall be paid at the rate for step three on the
corresponding salary schedule for the position being filled. A year of
service for a noncertificated employee shall be defined to be at least
120 days during a given contract year.
