================

The Board of Education does not discriminate against any employee or
applicant for employment with respect to hiring, compensation, terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment based on genetic information.
The Board also does not limit, segregate, or classify employees in any
way that would deprive or tend to deprive them of employment
opportunities or otherwise adversely affect the status of an employee as
an employee, based on genetic information. Retaliation against an
applicant or employee for engaging in protected activity is prohibited.

The Board shall only acquire and/or disclose genetic information of an
employee or applicant for employment as provided by Federal law and
regulation.

The Superintendent shall appoint a compliance officer whose
responsibility it will be to ensure that Federal regulations are
complied with and that any inquires or complaints are dealt with
promptly in accordance with law. S/He shall also ensure that proper
notice of nondiscrimination for Title II of the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 is provided to staff members.
