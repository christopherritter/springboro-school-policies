3242 - PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSURE
=============================================

The Board of Education directs the Superintendent to establish a
Professional Development Committee that is in compliance with State law
and applicable terms of the negotiated agreement with the Springboro
Education Association.

The Committee may be a District committee or one that is part of a
consortium of school districts. If a District committee is established,
it shall consist of no more than five (5) members of the bargaining unit
and three (3) District administrators.

The Superintendent or designee, in cooperation with the Committee, shall
be responsible for establishing the guidelines by which the Committee is
to function. These guidelines shall include:

A. a set of bylaws governing when and where the Committee will meet, how
the committee will select and replace members, the manner in which
voting will occur, and the procedure the Committee will use to hear
appeals of its decisions;

B. the criteria that will be used to determine whether or not a
professional development plan will be approved;

C. procedures for assessing the extent to which a staff member's
professional development plan has been accomplished.

The Superintendent shall report periodically to the Board on the
operation of this important committee and on the progress staff members
are making in fulfilling their professional development plans.
