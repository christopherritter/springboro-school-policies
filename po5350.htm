<H3>5350 - STUDENT SUICIDE</H3>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes that depression and self-destruction are problems of increasing severity among children and adolescents. A student who suffers the psychological disability or depression cannot benefit fully from the educational program of the schools and a student who has attempted self-destruction poses a danger both to himself/herself and to other students.</P>
<P>The Board directs all school personnel to be alert to the student who exhibits signs of unusual depression or who threatens or attempts suicide. Any such signs or the report of such signs from another student or staff member should be taken with the utmost seriousness and should be reported immediately to the building principal who shall notify the appropriate personnel. The principal may, if the circumstances so warrant, appoint a staff member to remain with the student. If at that time the student requires professional intervention, the student shall be referred to appropriate psychiatric services or to the County Children Services Board.</P>
<P>The student's parent or guardian shall be notified of any referral.</P>
