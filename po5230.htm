<H3>5230 - LATE ARRIVAL AND EARLY DISMISSAL</H3>
<P>It is necessary that a student be in attendance throughout the school day in order to benefit fully from the educational program of the District.</P>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes, however, that from time to time compelling circumstances will require that a student be late to school or dismissed before the end of the school day.</P>
<P>The Board shall require that the school be notified in advance of such absences by written request of the student's parent or guardian which shall state the reason for the tardiness or early dismissal.</P>
<P>If one (1) parent has been awarded custody of the student in a divorce settlement, the parent in custody as defined in statute shall submit copies of the court order(s) to the school district.) Absent such notice, the school will presume that the student may be released into the care of either parent.</P>
<P>No student who has a medical disability which may be incapacitating may be released from school without a person to accompany him/her.</P>
<P>No student shall be released from school to anyone whose signature authorizing such custody is not on file in the building.</P>
<P>R.C. 3313.20, 3313.64</P>
