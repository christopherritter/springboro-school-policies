{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes that vending machines can produce
revenues which are useful to augment programs and services to students
and staff. It will, therefore, authorize their use in District
facilities providing that the following conditions are satisfied.

The installation, servicing, stocking, and maintenance of each machine
are contracted for with a reputable supplier of vending machines and
their products.

The District's share of the revenues is managed by the Treasurer in
accordance with relevant Board policies and administrative guidelines.

The Superintendent and the Treasurer shall ensure these conditions are
adhered to on a continuing basis.

This policy does not prevent the District from purchasing, leasing,
servicing, stocking and/or maintaining its own vending machines.
