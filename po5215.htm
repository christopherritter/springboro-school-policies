<H3>5215 - MISSING AND ABSENT CHILDREN</H3>
<P>The Board of Education believes in the importance of trying to decrease the number of missing children. The Board will cooperate with Local, State, and National efforts to decrease the number of missing children. Efforts will be made to identify possible missing children and notify the proper adults or agencies.</P>
<P>A student, at the time of his/her initial entry to school shall present to the person in charge of admission a copy of his/her certificate of birth and any information provided by the school most recently attended. The person in charge of admission shall initiate contact with the sending school within forty-eight (48) hours or two (2) business days to request the student's official records. If the sending school, upon contact, indicates no record of the student or if after fourteen (14) days, no records are received, the principal shall notify the police department having jurisdiction in the area where the student resides of this fact.</P>
<P>The primary responsibility for attendance at school by a student rests with his/her parent(s) or guardian(s). The School District staff will provide the assistance it can to parents and guardians with this responsibility.</P>
<P>Parent(s)/guardian(s) must notify the school on the day a student is absent unless previous notification has been given in accordance with the school procedure for excused absences. If the school has not been so notified of the student's absence, the principal or his/her designee shall notify a student's parents, custodial parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person responsible for him/her. The parent or other responsible person shall be notified by telephone or written notice shall be mailed on the same day that the student is absent. Parents or other responsible persons shall provide the school with their current home and/or work telephone numbers and home addresses, as well as emergency telephone numbers.</P>
<P>Information for students, parents, and community members relative to missing children issues and matters shall be provided as it becomes available.</P>
