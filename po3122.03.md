3122.03 - AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA) GRIEVANCE - PROCEDURE
=====================================================================

The School District Board of Education designates the Director of
Education Services as the employee responsible for providing information
about the ADA to others and receiving and resolving complaints about
discrimination against the disabled.

Any person may file a complaint if s/he believes the Board has
discriminated against him/her on account of a disability. The person
filing the complaint is called the "grievant" and the complaint will be
called a "grievance". A "grievant" who is a member of a bargaining unit
covered by a negotiated agreement must use the grievance procedure in
the negotiated agreement to resolve any "grievance". All other employees
must utilize the following procedure.

The grievant must file the complaint on the ADA Grievance Form within
seven (7) calendar days of the date the discrimination allegedly
occurred.

The grievant must file the complaint with the Director of Education
Services.

The Director of Education Services will investigate the grievance and
respond within seven (7) calendar days.

When reviewing the grievance, the Director of Education Services will
determine whether the grievant is actually a "qualified person with a
disability", whether the employer may have discriminated against the
grievant, and whether the Board can reasonably accommodate the grievant
or otherwise resolve grievant's problem.
