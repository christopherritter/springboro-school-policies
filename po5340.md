5340 - STUDENT ACCIDENTS
========================

The Board of Education believes that school personnel have certain
reasonable responsibilities in case of accidents which occur in school.
These responsibilities include administering first aid by persons
trained to do so, summoning medical help, administrative personnel,
notifying parents, and filing accident reports.

Employees should administer first aid within the limits of their
knowledge of recommended practices. All employees should make an effort
to increase their understanding of the proper steps to be taken in the
event of an accident.

Regardless of the seriousness of any accident, the nurse or
administrator in charge shall submit an accident report to the
Superintendent.
