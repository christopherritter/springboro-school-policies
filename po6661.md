{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education directs the establishment of an account to be
known as the Textbook and Instructional Materials Account to provide
sufficient instructional materials to ensure a thorough and efficient
education for all District students. The monies are to be used strictly
for textbooks and instructional software, materials, supplies, and
equipment.

The Treasurer shall be responsible for the administration of the Account
and shall arrange to deposit into the Account each year the percentage,
designated by the State, of revenues received for operating expenses.

During any given fiscal year, monies may be appropriated for other
purposes than those listed above if the Board so resolves by unanimous
vote of all members after receiving written certification from the
Superintendent and the president of the Springboro Education Association
that the District has sufficient textbooks and instructional software,
materials, supplies, and equipment to ensure a thorough and efficient
education within the District.

This requirement is not to be superseded by any terms of a
collectively-bargained, negotiated agreement.
