<H3>4105 - INTERVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION</H3>
<P>It is the responsibility of the Superintendent to recommend suitable candidates to the Board of Education for employment in all noncertificated positions. In all cases, it will be the policy of the Board to hire the best qualified applicant for the position regardless of the background, experience, residence, and relationship to present employees or members of the Board.</P>
<P>It is also the responsibility of the Superintendent to assure that persons nominated for employment in the schools meet all state and local requirements for the type of position for which the nomination is made. All newly created positions must be approved by the Board.</P>
<P>With regard to new positions, the Board recognizes the need to establish, from time-to-time, additional noncertified positions in order to meet the District's support services needs.</P>
<P>A "Notice of Vacancy" will be prepared for all new and vacant positions in the District. This "Notice of Vacancy" will set forth a description of the position, performance expectations, minimum qualifications, conditions of employment, and the procedure for making application.</P>
<P>Present staff will be considered for new and vacant positions according to the procedures outlined in the negotiated agreement with the Springboro Classified Employees Association.</P>
<P>Persons interested in seeking employment in the School District must complete an Employment Application as available in the central office. Applicants, depending upon position desired, may be asked to take an aptitude or screening test as part of this application procedure. All applications will remain active for six (6) months from the date of the application.</P>
<P>Initial screening and interviewing of candidates for new and vacant positions will be conducted by the Superintendent or other administrators designated to do so by the Superintendent. The Superintendent will conduct final interviews with all candidates to be recommended for employment. References will be checked on all applicants under final consideration and criminal background checks will be conducted in accordance with State law. The Superintendent will make the final decision regarding nomination of a person to the Board for employment in the District.</P>
<P>The following general guidelines will be used in the selection of personnel:</P>
<P>A. Concerted efforts will be made to maintain a variation in the staff with respect to background, educational preparation, and previous experience.</P>
<P>B. Interviewing and selection procedures will assure that the administrator and/or supervisor directly responsible for the work of a staff member has a key role in selection. The final recommendation of a candidate for employment, however, will be made by the Superintendent.</P>
<P>C. All candidates will be considered on the basis of their merits, minimum qualifications, and needs of the District. In each instance, the Superintendent and others playing a role in the selection will seek to recommend the best qualified person for the position, regardless of the background, experience, residence, and relationship to present employees or members of the Board of Education.</P>
