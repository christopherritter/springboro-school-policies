title: 9321 - FINGERPRINTING STUDENTS
---

{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes the advantage to both parents and law
enforcement agencies of a means of identifying children who have become
lost or been abducted. Accordingly, the Board will cooperate with local
law enforcement authorities in fingerprinting students enrolled in the
schools of this District.

The Board will make school facilities available for the fingerprinting
of children by law enforcement officers and will notify the parent or
guardian of each eligible child that the service is available. The
notice will clearly state that fingerprinting is voluntary and that no
adverse consequences will result from a parent or guardian's refusal or
neglect to consent to the fingerprinting of his/her child.

The Board will permit the fingerprinting of only those children who
present the written consent of their parent or guardian. An adult
student may submit his/her own written consent.

Fingerprint records shall be given to the parent or guardian of the
child fingerprinted or to the adult student. No record of fingerprints
shall be retained by this Board and no record shall be made or retained
to identify those children who were fingerprinted or of those who
declined to be fingerprinted.
