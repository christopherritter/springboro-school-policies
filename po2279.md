{{ page.title }}
================

Educating students for responsible citizenship is a role of public
schools. Significant components of responsible citizenship in this
District shall include, but not be restricted to, a knowledge of:

A. the history of the United States of America;

B. the democratic principles of freedom, justice, and equality;

C. the development of our democratic form of government;

D. the necessity of citizen participation in political process to
maintain a democratic form of government;

E. our heritage - including customs, traditions, rituals, and symbols of
allegiance to our country (including accepted etiquette);

F. the USA's responsibilities in a global society.

This knowledge shall be reinforced by appropriate ceremonies and
observances which aid students in the development of their
interpretations of patriotism and citizenship.

The flag of the United States shall be raised above each school and/or
at other appropriate places during all school sessions, weather
permitting. The flag shall be raised before the opening of school and
taken down at its close every day.

The opportunity to participate in patriotic ceremonies, including
recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, shall occur on a regular basis
for all students. However, no student shall be compelled to participate
in the reciting of the Pledge. The Superintendent shall develop
administrative guidelines which ensure that those who conduct this
activity do it at an appropriate time, in an appropriate manner, and
with due regard to the need to protect the rights and the privacy of a
non-participating student.
