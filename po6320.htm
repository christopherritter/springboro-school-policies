<H3>6320 - COMPETITIVE BIDDING</H3>
<P>The following policy is adopted for the guidance of the administrative staff in identifying those items for which competitive bids must be obtained, to ensure compliance with State statutes, and to delegate the authority necessary to conduct the bidding procedures in an orderly and efficient manner.</P>
<P>Whenever the Board of Education builds, repairs, or enlarges a schoolhouse, whether by purchase, contract, or agreement including acquisition by sale, lease, exchange, discount, negotiation, mortgage, pledge, lien, issue or reissue, or any other voluntary transaction for consideration creating an interest in property not made by contract or agreement, such transaction shall be subject to bidding whenever the aggregate value of such purchase exceeds $25,000.</P>
<P>Annually the Board shall adopt a resolution to participate in Ohio's Cooperative Purchasing Act. The Agreement will be through the State of Ohio, Department of Administrative Services, Office of Cooperative Purchasing for the purchase of supplies, services, furnishings, equipment and certain materials as deemed by the Superintendent and Treasurer. Purchases made through this program may exceed the $25,000 bid limit.</P>
<P>Bids shall be opened publicly by the Treasurer before one (1) or more witnesses at a previously designated time and place. Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder upon resolution of the Board, unless the Board chooses to reject all bids.</P>
<P>Whenever a contractor shall submit a bid for the performance of work and the contractor later claims a mistake, error, or omission in preparing said bid, the contractor shall, before the bids are open, make known the fact and in such case, the bid shall be returned unopened.</P>
<P>In cases of urgent necessity, the above procedures may be dispensed with by resolution of the Board.</P>
