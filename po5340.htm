<P>The Board of Education believes that school personnel have certain reasonable responsibilities in case of accidents which occur in school. These responsibilities include administering first aid by persons trained to do so, summoning medical help, administrative personnel, notifying parents, and filing accident reports.</P>
<P>Employees should administer first aid within the limits of their knowledge of recommended practices. All employees should make an effort to increase their understanding of the proper steps to be taken in the event of an accident.</P>
<P>Regardless of the seriousness of any accident, the nurse or administrator in charge shall submit an accident report to the Superintendent.</P>
