<BODY>
<H1>7510 - USE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES</H1>
<P>The Board of Education believes that the public school facilities are provided primarily for the education of the children of the School District. The Board, however, encourages community use of buildings at times when such use will not interfere with the original and necessary purpose of the property and is consistent with the philosophy and goals of the District.</P>
<P>The Board will permit the use of school buildings and facilities for educational, civic, cultural, religious, and recreational as well as political activities that are consistent with the primary purpose of the schools, with State laws, and with the policies and guidelines of the Board when permission has been requested in writing by a responsible person representing an organization or group of citizens.</P>
<H3>Priority in Use of School Facilities</H3>
<P>The requirements of the regular school academic and extra-curricular program shall receive first priority in the use of school facilities. School-related organizations such as the PTO's, music and athletic boosters, or other approved booster organizations shall have priority over nonschool related groups and organizations. Nonschool related groups and members of groups who are residents of the School District shall have priority over nonresident groups and organizations. More specifically, the priority use of school facilities is outlined below.</P>
