The Board of Education, is committed to providing a free appropriate
public education to children with disabilities identified in accordance
with applicable State and Federal laws, rules, and regulations.

In order to satisfy the requirements of the Operating Standards for Ohio
Educational Agencies Serving Children with Disabilities ("Ohio Operating
Standards"), the Board of Education adopts the model policies and
procedures promulgated by the Ohio Department of Education's Office of
Exceptional Children (ODE-OEC), which is incorporated by reference into
this policy. While the Special Education Model Policies and Procedures
("Model Policies") issued by the ODE-OEC are comprehensive, the document

Revised Code, and/or the Ohio Administrative Code. As such, the Board
affirms its obligation to follow these laws and regulations, regardless
of whether their provisions are restated in the Model Policies.
