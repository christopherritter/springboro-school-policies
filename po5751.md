{{ page.title }}
================

No student, whether married or unmarried, who is otherwise eligible to
attend school in the District shall be denied an educational program
solely because of pregnancy, childbirth, pregnancy-related disabilities,
or actual or potential parenthood.

The Board of Education reserves the right to require as a prerequisite
for attendance in the regular classes of the schools and the
co-curricular and extra-curricular programs of the schools that each
pregnant student present to the Superintendent her physician's written
statement that such activity will not be injurious to her health nor
jeopardize her pregnancy.

A pregnant student will be considered on an excused absence for so long
a period as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician. At
the conclusion of the absence, the student shall be reinstated to the
status she held when the absence began.

R.C. 2151.85, 2505.073, 3321.01 et seq.
