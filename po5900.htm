<H3>5900 - RIGHTS OF DISABLED STUDENTS</H3>
<P>All reasonable efforts shall be made to identify unserved disabled children of the District eligible for special education and/or related services in accordance with Board Policy. A free appropriate public education shall be provided for each child determined to be in need of special education and/or related services. Such a program of special education shall be provided in the least restrictive environment and in barrier-free facilities comparable to those provided for nondisabled students. To the maximum extent appropriate to the student's disability, a disabled student shall be placed in an educational setting with nondisabled or less severely disabled students.</P>
<P>No student will be denied, because of his/her disability, participation in co-curricular, intramural or interscholastic activities, or any of the services offered or recognitions rendered regularly to the students of this District.</P>
