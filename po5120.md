================

The Board of Education directs that the assignment of students to
schools within this District be consistent with the best interests of
students and the best use of the resources of this District.

The Board shall determine periodically the school attendance areas of
the District and shall expect the students within each area to attend
the school so designated.

The Superintendent shall review existing attendance areas and recommend
to the Board such changes as may be justified by:

A. considerations of safe student transportation and travel;

B. convenience of access to schools;

C. financial and administrative efficiency;

D. the effectiveness of the instructional program;

E. a wholesome and educationally sound balance of student populations.

No assignment to schools or attendance schedules shall discriminate
against students on the basis of sex, race, religion, or national
origin.

The Superintendent may assign a student to a school other than that
designated by the attendance area when such exception is justified by
circumstances and is in the best interest of the student.

The building principal(s) shall assign students in his/her school to
appropriate grades, classes, or groups. This action shall be based on
consideration of the needs of the student as well as the administration
of the school.
