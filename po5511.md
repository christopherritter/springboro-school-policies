{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes that each student's mode of dress and
grooming is a manifestation of personal style and individual preference.
The Board will not interfere with the right of students and their
parents to make decisions regarding their appearance except when their
choices affect the educational program of the schools.

The Board authorizes the Superintendent to establish a reasonable dress
code in order to promote a safe and healthy school setting and enchance
the educational environment. The dress code shall be incorporated into
each school building's Student Handbook and Discipline Code. The
building principal is designated as the arbiter of student dress and
grooming in his/her building.

Accordingly, the Superintendent shall establish such grooming guidelines
and procedures as are necessary to promote discipline, maintain order,
secure the safety of students, and provide a healthy environment
conducive to academic purposes. Such guidelines shall prohibit student
dress or grooming practices which:

A. present a hazard to the health or safety of the student
himself/herself or to others in the school;

B. materially interfere with school work, create disorder, or disrupt
the educational program;

C. cause excessive wear or damage to school property;

D. prevent the student from achieving his/her own educational objectives
because of blocked vision or restricted movement.

Students who violate the foregoing guidelines will not be admitted to
class and may be suspended from school.
