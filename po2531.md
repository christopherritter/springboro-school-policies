2531 - COPYRIGHTED WORKS
========================

The Board of Education directs its staff to use copyrighted works only
to the extent that the law permits. The Board recognizes that Federal
law applies to public school districts and the staff must, therefore,
avoid acts of copyright infringement under penalty of law.

In order to help the staff abide by the laws set forth in Title 17 of
the United States Code, the Board directs the Superintendent to provide
administrative guidelines regarding the copying and distribution of
copyrighted materials for instructional purposes.
