The child shall have attained the age of five (5) by the first (1st) day of January of the kindergarten school year in which s/he is enrolled. Children who will not be the proper age for entrance to kindergarten by the first day of January of the school year for which admission is requested shall also be evaluated for early admittance if referred by an educator within the District, a pre-school educator who knows the child, or a pediatrician or psychologist who knows the child. Such children may also be evaluated at the discretion of the principal of the school to which the student may be admitted.</P>
<P>Before a student is evaluated for early entrance, the principal (or his/her designee) of the school to which the child may be admitted shall obtain written permission from the child’s parent/guardian.</P>
<P>When a parent or guardian requests early entrance to kindergarten, information for testing by a District psychologist will be provided. Such request should be made to the District Director of Instruction or the principal of the building of attendance for such child.</P>
<P>Standards required for such early admission are as outlined below:</P>

Parents of the child being considered shall provide name and addresses of the physician and non family member completed social, emotional, behavior survey. Three (3) completed surveys must be returned before the District committee will meet to considered recommendation.</P>
<P>The District committee (Pupil Personnel Services Committee) comprised of K-1 principal, kindergarten teacher, Director of Instruction, and the school psychologists who administered the testing, will review the data gathered from the above criteria and make a recommendation regarding early entrance admission or further evaluation. A written summary of the outcome of the evaluation process will be provided to parent/guardian along with instructions for appealing the outcome of the valuation process.</P>
