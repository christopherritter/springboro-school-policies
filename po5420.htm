<H1>5420 - REPORTING STUDENT PROGRESS</H1>
<H3>Purpose Statement</H3>
<P>The Springboro Community City School District recognizes the importance of cooperation between the home and school, and its responsibility in keeping parents informed of the progress of students in school. Student grading and progress reporting procedures are intended to reflect student competency in the mastery of learning objectives, student growth over the course of a school year (including citizenship and effort), and student achievement - what the student knows or can do.</P>
<P>Grading and progress reporting procedures shall provide guidance to teachers in evaluating student competency, growth, and achievement. Grading and reporting procedures shall also allow for flexibility in providing for individual needs and differences of students. Evaluation in terms of competency (mastery) and achievement shall not ignore individual differences among students nor shall evaluation in terms of effort mean that high standards have been ignored. Teachers are encouraged to emphasize competency and achievement in grading, but with the individual student in mind. Grading and reporting procedures shall apply to all learning situations within the school setting.</P>
<P>Grading and reporting procedures shall provide a regular and frequent source of information about the competence, growth, and achievement of students for parents, students, and others with an interest in the student's educational status. Grading and reporting procedures for each class shall be explained to parents either through direct parent contact or be sent home to parents. Grading procedures shall be based upon the assumption that students will respond to clear and accurate reporting of competence, growth, and achievement as positive opportunities for success rather than threats of failure. Criteria used to measure competence, growth, and achievement shall be designed to be as objective as possible and appropriate to the age and maturity of students. Criteria for grading shall be consistently reported, based upon valid educational practice, and based upon an appropriate number of demonstrated instances of student performance.</P>
<H3>Reporting Student Progress</H3><P>Student competency, growth and achievement will be reported in four nine-week or quarter grading periods for grades K – 12. A grade report will be sent to parents at the end of each grading period. All students should receive an appropriate amount of information about competence, growth and achievement from the results of work that has been reviewed and evaluated in the professional judgment of the teacher (i.e., Homework, in-class work, assessments, participation, and effort). Parents should be consulted if, in the teacher's judgment, the child's academic situation warrants parental contact. For grades K – 12, teachers shall use professional judgment to record an adequate number of instances of student performance as the basis of assigning grades. A minimum of nine (9) grades must be taken for each core academic subject as the basis of the nine-week/quarter grade. The following shall serve as the basis of assigned grades in the Springboro Community City Schools:</P>
<P>A. Mastery of Objectives</P>
<P>Mastery shall be determined through a variety of assessments such as tests, quizzes, projects, and classroom projects.</P>
<P>B. Other Criteria</P>
<P>Other criteria shall be used as a portion of the grade such as homework, daily class work, and class participation.</P>
<P>C. Greater emphasis shall be placed upon Mastery of Objectives rather than Other Criteria.</P>
<H3>Grade Reporting</H3>
<P>A. Student Grade Reporting: Grades K – 1</P>
<P>Grade reporting in grades K – 1 will be based on reporting the level of skill mastery in the grade level Ohio Academic Skill Indicators. To report progress toward mastery of skills codes that will be used will be "M" (Master), "AP" (Approaching Mastery); "N" (Not Met Expectation).</P>
<P>Course content is defined as mastery of indicators through assessment, homework, daily class work, and/or class participation.</P>
<P>B. Student Grade Reporting: Grades 2 – 5</P>
<P>Grade reporting in grades 2 – 5 will be a combination of percentages and checklists. In grades 2 and 3, checklists may be used to indicate mastery of specific skills within a content area. As students progress through the building, checklists may be shortened or eliminated.</P>
<P>Any percentage below seventy-five (75) will be considered non-proficiency of course content (course content is defined as mastery of objectives through assessment, homework, daily class work, and/or class participation).</P>
<P>*Unified Arts, Work Habits, and Conduct will use the codes "E" (Excellent), "S" (Satisfactory), "N" (Needs Improvement), and "U" (Unsatisfactory).</P>
<P>Grades 4 &amp; 5 will use the codes to report progress for codes "E" (Excellent), "S" (Satisfactory), "N" (Needs Improvement), and "U" (Unsatisfactory) for Handwriting.</P>
<P>No grade will exceed 100%.</P>
<P>C. Student Grade Reporting: Grades 6 – 12</P>
<P>Progress will be reported using percentages for all students in grades 6 – 12. Any percentage below sixty (60) will be considered failing course content (course content is defined as mastery of objectives through assessments, homework, daily class work, and/or participation). No grade will exceed 100% with the exception of "weighted classes."</P>
<H3>Progress (Interim) Reports</H3>
<P>The interim reporting process in the Springboro Community City Schools is designed as an important way for teachers to communicate to parents at the mid-point of each grading period. Teachers are asked to communicate to parents using the Interim Report Form designed for each grade. Principals shall determine the dates interim reports are to be sent home for each nine-week grading period.</P>
<P>A. Interim Reports: Grades K – 12</P>
<P>Interim reports will be created electronically for parents if a child is not mastering an academic content area (grade below 75% for grades 2-12 and a grade of N for grades K-1) or if there has been a significant drop in a content area, or at a teacher's discretion.</P>
<P>B. A paper copy of an interim report will be sent home for those parents/guardians who have not logged onto Progress Book within thirty (30) days prior to the interim reporting date.</P>
<H3>Grade Point Averages (Including Weighted Classes)</H3>
<P><B>A. Springboro Junior High School</B></P>
<P>Grade Point Averages (GPA) shall be calculated each nine (9) weeks and reported to students and parents in the form of a percentage average on the report card.</P><P>Grade point averages in grades 6 – 8 shall be calculated as a percentage GPA based upon grades earned in classes.</P>

<P>Note: Weighted classes shall receive percentage weighting and quality point weighting based upon the above chart. Teachers of weighted classes shall, after computing a percentage grade, add ten (10) percentage points to the grade and apply it to the above scale. Please note that a cumulative percentage average will not necessarily be within the quality pointy value range.</P>
<P>If a student receives an incomplete for a quarter grade, the student shall have ten (10) school days following the end of the quarter to complete the missing work. At the end of these ten (10) days, the incomplete will change to the percentage grade as reported by the teacher. In the case of extended absences, a student may receive approval from the <B>building principal</B> to exceed ten (10) days.</P>
<H3>Semester Assessments: Grades 9 – 12</H3>
<P>A. Purpose</P>
<P>Semester assessments are to be administered in all classes at Springboro High School and in classes at Springboro Junior High School which are receiving high school credit, covering the equivalent of two (2) nine-weeks of study. Semester assessments are to be designed as a cumulative assessment of major concepts covered in each semester or year long class. Assessments are to be designed in an appropriate manner to elicit responses from students which show competence in major concepts covered during the semester.</P>
<P>B. Format for Assessment</P>
<P>Semester assessments are to be cumulative in nature. Teachers may use examinations, alternative assessments, or a combination of both. Examinations are to be designed using appropriate test construction techniques. Alternative assessments will be cumulative in nature and approved by the building principal at least three (3) weeks prior to the administration dates.</P>
<P>C. Semester Assessments Grade Policy</P>
<P>Semester assessments shall count twenty percent (20%) of the total semester grade, with each nine-week grade counting forty percent (40%) of the total semester grade.</P>
<P>D. Exam Exemption</P>
<P>Students may be exempt from semester assessments if they meet requirements of the exam exemption procedures. The exam exemption procedures shall be reviewed periodically and announced to students and parents at the beginning of the school year.</P>
<H3>Semester Credit</H3>
<P>To receive credit for a semester course, the student must receive a sixty percent (60%) or higher for the second quarter of the class (note this may be the fourth quarter of the year) and receive a semester average of sixty percent (60%) or higher.</P>
<P>To receive credit for a year long class, the student must receive a sixty percent (60%) or higher for the second semester and receive a grade for the year of sixty percent (60%) or higher.</P>
<H3>Criteria for Honors/Awards</H3>
<P>A. Springboro Junior High School</B></P>
<P>A nine-week percentage grade point average shall be used to determine qualification for the Honor Roll and the Principal's List at Springboro Junior High School as outlined below:</P>
<P>Honor Roll: Percentage grade point average between eighty-three (83) and eighty-nine (89) with no one percentage grade below 75.</P>
<P>Principals' List: Percentage grade point average of ninety (90) or above with no one percentage grade below eighty-five (85).</P>
<P>National Junior Honor Society: Percentage grade point average of ninety-three (93) or above makes a student eligible for consideration into NJHS.</P>
<P>B. Springboro High School</B></P>
<P>A nine-week percentage grade point average shall be used to determine qualifications for the Honor Roll and the Principal's List at Springboro High School as outlined below:</P>
<P>Honor Roll: Percentage grade point average between 83 and 89 with no one percentage grade below 75, with no grade of incomplete and two (2) or fewer disciplinary referrals.</P>
<P>Principals' List: Percentage grade point average of ninety (90) or above with no one percentage grade below eighty-five (85),with no grade of imcomplete and two (2) or fewer disciplinary referrals.</P>
<P>A cumulative percentage grade point average shall be used to determine qualifications for other awards as outline below:</P>
<P>National Honor Society: A percentage grade point average of ninety-three (93) or above makes a student eligible for consideration in NHS.</P>
<P>Valedictorian: Highest cumulative percentage grade point.</P>
<P>Salutatorian: Second highest cumulative percentage grade point.</P>
<H3>Transfer Students</H3>
<P>When students transfer into the District, school personnel will request an official transcript from the student's previous school. The grades earned by the student, if percentages, will be recorded. If the grades from the previous school are not listed as percentages, the grades will be transferred to Springboro's Junior High or High School percentage grading scale, and the appropriate credit will be granted.</P>
<P>If the grades earned at the previous school do not correspond to Springboro's grading scale, the grade shall be entered at the midpoint of the Junior High or High School percentage grade/letter grade scale.</P>
<H3>Conduct Grade Recommendations</H3>
<P>A. Grades K - 5</B></P>
<P>Conduct will be reported as "E" (Excellent), "S" (Satisfactory) "N" (Needs Improvement), and "U" (Unsatisfactory).</P>
<P>B. Springboro Junior High School and Springboro High School</B></P>
<P>Communications with parents about a student's conduct and citizenship is important. Although the Grading Policy Committee recommends that a conduct grade not be reported on the report card, comments will be added to the report card for discipline/conduct for selection by the teacher. The individual buildings may develop other methods of reporting citizenship and conduct to parents.</P>
<TR>
<P>Although citizenship will not be reported as a grade on report cards, student behavior can affect grades due to unexcused absence, suspension, or expulsion. As stated in Board Policy, "When a student is suspended or expelled from school, the days will be classified as unexcused absences. Therefore, the student will not be able to make up work missed during the period of suspension or expulsion. In the case of suspension, however, the principal may use discretion to allow the make-up of semester/final exams and long term assignments (but is not limited to these), providing the student requests such make-up work and that the request is made within twenty-four (24) hours of the effective date of the suspension." This may affect the student's grade for those classes.</P>
