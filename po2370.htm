Such options may include, but not be limited to, distance learning, on-line coursework, tutorial programs, independent study, correspondence courses, educational travel, mentorship programs, summer school, and early college entrance.</P>
<P>Prior approval of the educational option application by the Superintendent shall be required before a student participates in one (1) of the available educational options. Prior permission of a parent or guardian shall also be required before a student under age eighteen (18) participates in one (1) of the available educational options.</P>
<P>Participation in an educational option shall be in accordance with an instructional plan which will be developed based on the individual student's needs. The instructional plan will include:</P>
<P>A. instructional objectives that align with District's curriculum requirements;</P>
<P>B. a description of the criteria and method for assessing student performance;</P>
<P>C. an outline of specific instructional activities, materials and learning environments.</P>
<P>Participation must be subject to the oversight of a credentialed teacher who will review the instructional plan, provide or supervise instruction, and evaluate student performance.</P>
