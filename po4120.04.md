================

The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to procure the
services of substitute noncertificated staff in order to prevent the
interruption of the operation of the schools.

The names of potential substitute personnel and the positions in which
they may substitute shall be maintained by the office of Human
Resources.

Relatives of staff members may be employed by the Board, provided the
staff member being employed is not placed in a position in which s/he is
supervised directly by the relative staff member.

Relatives of Board members may be employed by the Board, provided the
member of the Board involved does not participate in any way in the
discussion or vote.

The employment of substitute noncertificated staff prior to approval by
the Board is authorized when their employment is required to maintain
continuity of services in the District.

Retroactive employment shall be recommended to the Board at the next
meeting.

In order to retain reliable assistance in the absence of regular
noncertificated personnel, the Board will offer competitive compensation
to qualified substitutes.

Noncertificated substitutes will be paid on a per diem basis at a rate
set by the Board.

Substitutes may be required to undergo a tuberculosis examination in
accordance with law and at the direction of the Ohio Department of
Health or the local health department.

Substitutes also must pass a background check performed by the Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (see Policy [**4121**](po4121.md)).
