<H3>2312 - MINIMUM CLASS ENROLLMENT</H3>
<P>A course must have at least fifteen (15) students registered for the course before it is included in the master schedule. Exceptions to this number are for special education classes, independent study assignments, or correspondence classes.</P>
<P>The second year and each succeeding year of a sequential course must have at least ten (10) students registered for the course before it is included in the master schedule. (This requirement does not preclude the administration from establishing independent study assignments.)</P>
<P>When a course is not included in the master schedule because of enrollment below minimum, it will be offered on alternate years before a decision is made to eventually remove it from the curriculum.</P>
<P>Exceptions to the above may be made with the approval of the Superintendent or his/her designee.</P>
