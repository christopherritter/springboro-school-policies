{{ page.title }}
================

In recognizing its responsibility to uphold the minimum educational
standards of the State of Ohio, the Board of Education establishes the
following policy and criteria regarding the acceptance of credits from
nonpublic schools whether they be State-chartered, special, or
nonchartered schools.

For credit or course-work to be accepted for courses taken in such
schools, either a copy of the charter or other assurance of compliance
with minimum requirements established by the State must be provided.

Recognition of credits or course-work shall be granted when the proper
assurance and the student's transcript has been received. The District
reserves the right to assess such transfer students in order to
determine proper placement and to be assured the student can demonstrate
the learnings which are prerequisite to a placement.

Although credits from nonchartered schools may be granted and placed on
a student's transcript, no grades will be entered on the transcript or
considered for class ranking. Only grades awarded for courses taken at
the District or at a school approved or chartered by a State education
agency shall be considered in class ranking and for entering on the
transcript.
