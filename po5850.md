5850 - SOCIAL EVENTS
====================

The Board of Education recognizes the value of student social events and
class trips in enhancing and enriching the school experience for the
children of this community.

The Board will make school facilities available and provide appropriate
staff for the conduct of social events within the school facilities
which have been approved by the Superintendent and the building
principal. For social events which take place outside school facilities,
approval is required by the Superintendent.

As voluntary participants in school social events and class trips,
students shall be held responsible for compliance with rules set forth
for their conduct, and infractions of those rules will be subject to the
same disciplinary measures as are applied during the regular school
program.

Participation in school events is not a right and may be denied to any
student who has demonstrated disregard for the rules of the school.

The Superintendent shall develop procedures for the conduct of student
social events which shall include the following:

A. the designation of a staff member who shall be the Board employee
responsible for the event

B. the provision of adequate chaperonage, adult supervision or police
protection as required by the circumstances of the event
