<B><P>3214 - STAFF GIFTS</P></B>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes that occasionally students or parents may feel motivated to give gifts of nominal value to professional staff as a gesture of fellowship or in thanks for some special help given by the staff member. However, the Board does not encourage such giving, nor may any employee encourage it.</P>
<P>Such gift-giving is acceptable only if the gift is negligible in monetary value, and is given under circumstances in which it is clear that the gift is not soliciting future favorable treatment from the employee. The Superintendent may approve acts of generosity to individual staff members in unusual circumstances.</P>
<P>The Board shall consider, as appropriate, presenting token gifts to retiring members of the staff who have rendered outstanding service for an extended period of time and who have earned the high regard of other staff members and the community.</P>
<P>Professional staff members shall not accept any form of compensation from vendors that might influence their recommendations on the eventual purchase of equipment, supplies, or services. Furthermore, professional staff members shall not accept any compensation from a vendor after a decision has been made to purchase equipment, supplies, or services from said vendor. In addition, professional staff members who recommend purchases shall not enter into a contractual arrangement with a vendor seeking to do business with the District, or a vendor with whom the District is doing business, whereby an individual professional staff member receives compensation in any form for services rendered.</P>
<B><I>
</B></I><P>Such compensation includes, but is not limited to, cash, checks, stocks, or any other form of securities, and gifts such as televisions, microwave ovens, computers, discount professionals, travel vouchers, tickets, passes, and other such things of value. In the event that a professional staff member receives such compensation, albeit unsolicited, from a vendor, the professional staff member shall notify the Treasurer, in writing, that s/he received such compensation and shall thereafter promptly transmit said compensation to the Treasurer.</P>
