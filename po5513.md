{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education believes that the schools should help students
learn to respect property and develop feelings of pride in community
institutions.

The Board charges each student in the schools of this District with
responsibility for the proper care of school property and the school
supplies and equipment entrusted to his/her use. A reward may be offered
by the Board for apprehending any person who vandalizes school property.

The Board reserves the right to offer a reward to persons other than
school employees and their immediate family for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of any person who commits any violation of law
on property owned or under the control or management of the Board.

In accordance with law, students who cause damage to school property
shall be subject to disciplinary measures and their parents shall be
financially liable for such damage to the extent of the law except that
students over eighteen (18) years of age shall also be liable for damage
they cause.

The Board authorizes the imposition of fines for the loss, damage or
destruction of school equipment, apparatus, musical instruments, library
material, textbooks, and for damage to school buildings and reserves the
right to withhold a report card from any student whose payment of such
fine is in arrears.

The Board may report to the appropriate juvenile authorities any student
whose damage of school property has been serious or chronic in nature.

In no case shall such referral to juvenile authorities be made without
prior notification to the student's parent.

The Superintendent shall develop procedures to implement this policy.
