================

The Board of Education wishes to honor contributions of its staff,
former Board members, other non-employee persons, students, citizens,
and advisory groups with plaques, pins, token retirement gifts and
awards, with appropriate recognitions and authorizes administrators to
purchase meals, refreshments, and other amenities.

The Board affirms that the expenses incurred as listed above do serve a
valid and proper public purpose. However, under no circumstances will
public funds be expended for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. The
Board believes that the "public purpose" served is the promotion of
education, rapport with the business community, community relations, and
the encouragement of non-employees to serve as volunteers. The funds
shall be those available from interest earned from the Board's General
Fund investment program.

The Board authorizes the establishment of appropriation code(s) for
promotion purposes in an amount(s) determined annually by the Board.

The Superintendent is authorized to approve all expenditures from this
appropriation account.
