{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes the service provided to the country
and the individual sacrifices made by veterans of World War II and the
Korean Conflict and the Vietnam Conflict.

Since many of these veterans left high school in order to fight for
their country, the Board wishes to recognize their efforts by awarding
them a high school diploma.

To be eligible for a diploma, all of the following criteria must be met:

A. The veteran is a current resident of the State of Ohio or was
previously enrolled in any high school in this State.

B. The veteran either left a public or nonpublic school located in any
state prior to graduation:

​1. in order to serve in the armed forces of the United States;

​2. due to family circumstances and subsequently entered the armed
forces of the United States.

C. The veteran received an honorable discharge from the armed forces of
the United States.

D. The veteran has not been granted a high school diploma, a diploma of
adult education, or a diploma under this provision.

If the veteran is deceased, the Board will award a diploma to the
veteran posthumously and present that diploma to a surviving relative of
the veteran.

The Board may award a high school diploma after receiving the
application and appropriate verification of eligibility from the
Governor's Office of Veterans' Affairs. The application is available
through and the eligibility verification is handled by the County
Veterans Services Office.
