<H3>9140 - CITIZENS ADVISORY COMMITTEES</H3>
<P>The Board of Education believes its members are elected to represent the interests of the public and students in the management of the District schools. One major responsibility is to keep in touch with public opinion and provide for effective two-way communication.</P>
<P>To assist in fulfilling this responsibility, the Board encourages the formation of advisory committees of local lay citizens. Lay citizen advisory committees may assist in identifying needs, provide input for setting District policies, make studies and recommendations regarding specific problems confronting the schools, serve as communication links between the citizens and the policy makers, and pursue any other purposes assigned by the Board.</P>
<P>Advisory committees will be established by the Superintendent and/or Board, serve in an advisory capacity, and serve at the pleasure of the Superintendent and/or Board.</P>
<P>Members of citizens' committees will be approved by a majority vote of the Board in an official session.</P>
<P>Citizen advisory groups will be broadly representative and will ensure that their recommendations are based on extensive research and facts. A Board member will not serve as a voting member on an advisory committee.</P>
<P>All advice provided by lay citizen committees will be given careful consideration. In evaluating such considerations, the first concern will be for the educational program as it affects students. The final decision may depart from the advice when, in the judgment of staff and the Board, such advice is not consistent with goals adopted by the Board or within the reach of financial resources available.</P>
<P>Examples of Citizens Advisory Committees would include, but not be limited to: Business Advisory Council, Curriculum Council, and Citizens Advisory Council.</P>
