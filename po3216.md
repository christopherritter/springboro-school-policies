3216 - STAFF DRESS AND GROOMING
===============================

The Board of Education believes that staff members set an example in
dress and grooming for their students to follow. A staff member who
follows this principle improves the importance of his/her task, presents
an image of dignity and encourages respect for authority. These are
positive factors for maintaining discipline.

The Board retains the authority to specify the following dress and
grooming guidelines for staff, as a means of creating a positive impact
on the educational process. All staff members shall, when assigned to
District duty:

A. be physically clean, neat, and well groomed;

B. dress in a manner reflecting their professional assignment;

C. dress in a manner that is commonly accepted in this community;

D. dress in a manner that does not cause damage to District property;

E. be groomed in such a way that their hair style or dress does not
disrupt the educational process nor cause a health or safety hazard.

The principal may, at his/her discretion and within the general
guidelines of this policy, establish more definitive guidelines for
dress and grooming necessary for maintaining a professional atmosphere.

If a teacher thinks that an exception to this policy would enable
him/her to carry out assigned duties more effectively, a request shall
be made to the principal.
