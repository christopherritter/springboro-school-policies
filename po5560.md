---

{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education believes that the students of this District are
entitled to an education free from undue disruption. Students who
willfully disrupt the educational program shall be subject to the
discipline procedures of this District. Every reasonable effort shall be
made to determine and remediate the cause or causes of a chronically
disruptive student's unacceptable conduct.

Disruptive students in the secondary grades will be disciplined in
accordance with Board policy on suspension and expulsion. Disruptive
students in the elementary grades will be reported to the building
principal, who may discipline the student in accordance with Board
policy on student discipline. A student who continually and willfully
disobeys persons in authority and violates school rules shall be
reviewed to determine the cause of his/her unacceptable conduct, assess
his/her educational needs, and, if appropriate, plan an instructional
program to meet those needs.

The Superintendent shall report regularly to the Board the incidence of
acts of violence and vandalism in the School District and shall prepare
a remedial plan whenever the report shows a significant increase in the
number of such acts.
