{{ page.title }}
================

It is the policy of the Board of Education that when the District
receives in trust from a public agency information identified as
confidential (whether such information is confidential by Ohio Law,
Common Law Privilege, Case Law, or Federal Law), the Board will maintain
the confidentiality of said information to the maximum extent permitted
by the law.

This policy applies **only** to identified confidential information
received from a public agency.

In order to prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of information
identified as confidential by the sending public agency, the Board may
seek to obtain court protection by:

A. denying requests for release of such information absent subpoena or
court order;

B. pursuing motions to quash or protective orders to prohibit
unauthorized disclosure.

When possible, the Board will attempt to notify the sending public
agency of the request for release of such information prior to complying
with the request.

Adopted 2/25/03
