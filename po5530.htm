<H3>5530 - SUBSTANCE ABUSE EDUCATION AND INTERVENTION</H3><P>A.</P>
<H3>Philosophy Statement</B></P>
<P>The Springboro Community School District recognizes its responsibility to provide all students with an environment conducive to the development of their maximum learning potential. The presence of alcohol and other drugs in the school or students who have alcohol and other drug problems is a deterrent to learning, thereby limiting, interfering with or inhibiting the primary responsibility vested in the educational system.</P>
<P>The Board has established a drug free zone within 1000 feet of any facility used by the District for educational purposes.</P>
<P>The District is concerned about the disruption of the learning environment of all students exposed to alcohol and other drug related behaviors. The District is concerned about the health of its students. Students adversely affected by alcohol and other drugs in the school increase the likelihood that the safety and well being of our students will be disrupted through accidents, fights, absenteeism, poor academic performance, chronic discipline problems, etc.</P>
<P>Springboro Community Schools Board recognizes that student alcohol and other drug use is wrong and harmful. Student alcohol and other drug use is a community problem requiring a community solution. Since the Springboro Community Schools are an integral part of the community, it is in the best interest of the community that steps be taken to promote, enhance, and maintain a drug-free school environment. The District also recognizes that alcohol and other drug use may lead to addiction, a treatable medical disease. In response, it is the policy to provide discipline as well as positive action to address alcohol and other drug use and/or dependency.</P>
<P>In developing this policy, the Board has tried to maintain a balance between compassion and aid to students suffering from alcohol and other drug use, and the protection of the academic environment of students who wish to learn. It is recognized that the rights of students who do not use alcohol and other drugs must be protected. They should not have to be exposed to the possibility of being involved in illegal activities. The Board recognizes that the rights of administrators and teachers to perform their duties must be protected. They must take their place as educators and not perform the duties of police or a diagnostician. Additionally it is important to recognize the School District is not a treatment program. Diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare are complex processes that require trained specialists. Instead our goals are <B>education/prevention</B>, <B>intervention/referral</B> and <B>support/guidance</B>.</P>
<P>The Board is responsible for establishing a policy and directing its implementation. The policy is enforced by District administrators and Drug Free Schools program Coordinator. The Board calls upon administrators, faculty, staff, parents and students to collectively ensure the policy's success.</P>
<P>B.</P>
<H3>Policy Statement</B></P>
<P>The Board shall not permit any student to possess, transmit, conceal, show evidence of having consumed, be under the influence of, use or offer for sale any alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, unprescribed drugs, look-alike drugs or any mind altering substance while on school grounds or facilities; at school sponsored events; in other situations under the authority of the District or in controlled vehicles, which include, school owned vehicles and private vehicles parked on school property or at school sponsored events. Included in this prohibition are any substances represented as a controlled substance, nonalcoholic beers, steroids, tobacco and tobacco products, and any drug-related paraphernalia as the term is defined by law.</P>
<P>Students found in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action as prescribed within the student code of conduct up to and including expulsion and referral for prosecution. A reduction in penalty may be granted if the student receives professional assistance. Professional assistance may include but not be limited to assessment with follow through based on the assessment findings, an alcohol/drug education program; counseling, outpatient treatment or inpatient treatment. Students who need to take prescription or nonprescription medications must adhere to the policies described within the student handbook.</P>
<P>C.</P>
<H3>Education/Prevention</B></P>
<P>The District will take a comprehensive, progressive, age appropriate approach in the development of curricula and programs which promote positive life skill development and an awareness of the consequences associated with alcohol and other drug use. The guidelines, goals, and objectives for prevention/education development will be based on information provided through our local advisory board, Ohio Department of Education, and the Ohio Prevention and Education Resource Center.</P>
<P>Additionally, opportunities for continued alcohol and other drug use prevention and intervention staff training and awareness will be made available in order to enhance the consistent implementation and success of this policy.</P>
<P>D.</P>
<H3>Intervention/Referral</B></P>
<P>It shall be the policy of the schools to provide an intervention process designed to confront problem behaviors within students which may indicate alcohol and other drug use. Intervention strategies will reflect a collaboration of staff administrators, guidance and drug free schools program coordinator. Intervention strategies will be initiated but not limited to the following circumstances:</P>
<P>1. Students seeking help.</P>
<P>2. Students exhibiting inappropriate, unusual or atypical behavior.</P>
<P>3. Disciplinary action involving violations of this policy and the student code of conduct.</P>
<P>A working relationship will exist among the District and local professional helping agencies in order to enhance familiarity, communication, referral and follow-up.</P>
<P>The District will maintain a file of information about any drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation and re-entry programs that are available to students.</P>
<P>Students successfully completing an inpatient treatment program will not be penalized for days missed from school. Students will be recognized as absent due to medical reasons. Every effort will be made by the schools to maintain contact with the treatment agency and provide academic instructional materials. Additionally, every effort will be made by the District to assure the students successful transition back into the school atmosphere.</P>
<P>E.</P><H3>Support/Guidance</B></P>
<P>Springboro Community Schools recognizes the importance of guidance activities which provide support to students who are experiencing problems either directly or indirectly due to alcohol and other drug use. Therefore, programs such as individual guidance, support groups and mentorship programs will be utilized as a means of providing support and guidance to students within the school environment. Such activities may also be provided which promote drug free lifestyles and support for students who are concerned in regards to a loved ones alcohol or other drug use.</P>
<P>F.</P><H3>Parent/Community</B></P>
<P>Parent involvement must coincide with school efforts in order for significant and consistent positive impact in regards to student alcohol and other drug use. Therefore, through the community arm of our drug free schools program and guidance plan, parent education programs shall be made available to the community. These programs will focus on parental prevention and intervention strategies.</P>
<P>G.</P>
<H3>Student and Parent Notification</B></P>
<P>At the beginning of each school year, the student code of conduct is to be reviewed with every student as part of the orientation process. Students and parents will be notified that compliance with this policy, and standards of conduct set forth in the student code of conduct, are mandatory. Notices will be sent home to parents and/or guardians, requiring a parental signature each year, in order to ensure parental support and compliance.</P>
<P>Additionally, the Superintendent shall establish administrative guidelines necessary to ensure that proper notice regarding the use of anabolic steroids is posted in each of the District's locker rooms used by students in grades 7-12.</P>
