<P>The Board of Education shall consist of five (5) members elected at large.</P>
<P>0141.2</P><H3>Conflict of Interest</B></P>
<P>A Board member shall not have any direct or indirect monetary interest in a contract with the School District; nor shall s/he furnish directly any labor, equipment, or supplies to the District for compensation; nor shall s/he be employed by the Board in any capacity for compensation.</P>
<P>In the event a Board member is employed by a corporation or business which furnishes goods or services to the School District, the Board member shall declare his/her association with the organization and refrain from debating or voting upon the question of the contract. It is not the intent of this policy to prevent the District from contracting with corporations or businesses because a Board member is an employee of the firm. The policy is designed to prevent placing a Board member in a position where his/her interest in the public schools and his/her interest in his/her place of employment might conflict and to avoid appearances of conflict of interest even though such conflict may not exist.</P>
<P>Among the conflicts which law specifically forbids:</P>
<P>A. the prosecuting attorney or city attorney from serving on the Board of Education</P>
<P>B. a Board member from serving as the School dentist, physician, or nurse</P>
<P>C. a Board member from being employed for compensation by the Board</P>
<P>D. a Board member from having, directly or indirectly, any monetary interest in any contract with the Board</P>

<P>F. a Board member from accepting a reward, gift, or reduction in price for favoring, recommending, or advocating the introduction, adoption, or use in the school, of a textbook, map, chart, or any other school supply</P>
<P>G. a Board member, for a period of one (1) year after leaving office, from accepting employment with the Board where such employment was authorized by the Board while s/he was a member thereof</P>
<P>H. a Board member from soliciting, or using the authority or influence of his/her office, to secure employment with the Board</P>
<P>I. a Board member from voting, deliberating, participating in discussions, or otherwise using the authority or influence of his/her office to create a position with the School District or to set the compensation for such position where s/he is considering, or is being considered for, employment in that position</P>
<P>J. a Board member from having interest in the contract for the purchase of property, supplies, or fire insurance by any county, township, municipal corporation, board of education, or public institution anywhere in the State of Ohio if such contract exceeds $150 unless the contract is let by competitive bidding</P>
<P>K. a Board member whose spouse is an employee in the District may not vote, authorize, or use the influence of his/her office to secure approval of an employment contract with his/her spouse. Neither may s/he vote, deliberate, discuss, or otherwise attempt to influence a collectively-bargained, negotiated agreement affecting his/her spouse if the spouse is an officer, negotiating team or committee of the employee organization or if the agreement includes provisions for health insurance under which said Board member is covered as a benefit of the spouse's employment</P>
<P>L. a Board member is prohibited from soliciting or accepting a thing of value that could have an improper influence upon the Board member’s duties.</P>
<P>M. a Board member is prohibited from using the authority or influence of his/her public position to secure a job for a family member. The Board member may not vote, discuss, recommend, or otherwise use the prestige of his/her office, formally or informally, to get a family member a job. A Board member may not participate in any decision, or use his/her position to secure any decision that affects the continuation, implementation, or terms and conditions of a family member's employment. A Board member may not participate, formally or informally, in any matter that directly affects a family member's employment, including: (1) changes in compensation or benefits; (2) assignment of duties; (3) evaluations; and (4) actions involving promotions, disciplinary actions, lay-offs, and removal. A Board member is also prohibited from influencing the decisions or actions of other officials or employees, particularly subordinates, regarding a family member's job or any job-related benefits.</P>
<P>A Board member is prohibited from improperly using his/her position to secure the donation of a cost of a meal, reception, or open house at a conference of an association of public officials and employees to which s/he or his/her Board belongs, while the Board member is simultaneously engaged in governmental business or regulatory activity directly affecting the related interests of the person solicited.</P>
