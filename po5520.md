{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes the right of each student to attend
school for the purpose of receiving an education. The disruption of the
educational program of the schools by disorder or any other purposeful
activity will not be acceptable.

For purposes of this policy, disorder shall be any deliberate activity
by an individual or a group, whether peaceful or violent, which
interferes with the normal operation of the school.

The Board, having the responsibility for providing an educational
program for the students of this District, shall have the authority to
preserve order for the proper functioning of that program.

Students shall not be disturbed in the exercise of their
constitutionally guaranteed rights to assemble peaceably and to express
ideas and opinions, privately or publicly, provided that such exercise
does not infringe on the rights of others and does not interfere with
the operation of the schools.

Activities which shall be disallowed by the Board include those which:

A. materially disrupt classwork or provoke substantial disorder or
invasion of others' rights;

B. involve the use of obscenity or themes considered to be harmful to
the normal development of impressionable students;

C. involve slander or false statements;

D. are grossly prejudicial in nature;

E. advocate or encourage use of substances or materials known to be
harmful or dangerous;

F. advocate the use of force or the violation of laws or school
guidelines;

G. advertise or sell products or services for unauthorized commercial
gain.

The Superintendent shall develop procedures for the implementation of
this policy.
