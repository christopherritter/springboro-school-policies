7540 - COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORKS
=======================================

The Board of Education is committed to the effective use of technology
to both enhance the quality of student learning and the efficiency of
Board operations. It also recognizes that safeguards have to be
established to ensure that the Board's investment in both hardware and
software is achieving the benefits of technology and inhibiting negative
side effects. As such, the Board directs that students are educated
about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other
individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and
cyberbullying awareness and response.

The Superintendent is directed to establish administrative guidelines
not only for proper acquisition of technology but also to provide
guidance to staff and students concerning making appropriate and ethical
use of the Board's computers and other technological equipment.

The Superintendent shall further establish appropriate procedures to
inform both staff and students about disciplinary actions that will be
taken if Board technology and/or networks are abused in any way or used
in an illegal or unethical manner.
