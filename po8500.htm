<P>The Board of Education shall provide cafeteria facilities in all school facilities where space and facilities permit, and will provide food service for the purchase and consumption of lunch for all students. The Board shall annually encumber the funds needed to operate the program.</P>
<P>The food-service program shall comply with Federal and State regulations pertaining to the selection, preparation, consumption, and disposal of food and beverages as well as to the fiscal management of the program.</P>
<P>The Board shall approve and implement nutrition standards governing the types of food and beverages that may be sold on the premises of its schools and shall specify the time and place each type of food or beverage may be sold. In adopting such standards, the Board shall:</P>
<P>A. consider the nutritional value of each food or beverage;</P>
<P>B. consult with a dietitian licensed under R.C. Chapter 4759, a dietetic technician registered by the commission on dietetic registration, or a school nutrition specialist certified or credentialed by the school nutrition association; and</P>
<P>C. consult and incorporate to the maximum extent possible the dietary guidelines for Americans jointly developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Department of Health and Human Services.</P>
<P>No food or beverage may be sold on any school premises except in accordance with the standards approved by the Board.</P>
<P>In addition, as required by law, a food safety program that is based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system shall be implemented with the intent of preventing food-borne illnesses. For added safety and security, access to the facility and the food stored and prepared therein shall be limited to food service program staff and other authorized persons.</P>
<P>The Board shall provide a Federal food service program for students during summer intervention programs that are mandated under Federal law. If the Board determines that it is unable to provide a Federal food service program during the summer, for financial reasons, the Board will communicate that decision to its residents in a manner it determines to be appropriate.</P>
<P>During all times while the food service program is operating and students are being served food, at least one (1) employee shall be present in the area in which the food is being consumed who has received instruction in methods to prevent choking and demonstrated an ability to perform the Heimlich maneuver.</P>
<P>Lunches sold by the school may be purchased by students and staff members and community residents in accordance with administrative guidelines established by the Superintendent. Lunches may be made available, free of charge, to senior citizens who are serving as volunteers to the District.</P>
<P>The operation and supervision of the food-service program shall be the responsibility of the Superintendent or his/her designee. In accordance with Federal law, The Superintendent or his/her designee shall take such actions as are necessary to obtain a minimum of two (2) food safety inspections per school year, which are conducted by the State or local governmental agency responsible for food safety inspections. The report of the most recent inspection will be posted in a publicly visible location, and a copy of the report will be available upon request. </P>
<P>A periodic review of the food-service accounts shall be made. Any surplus funds from the National School Lunch Program shall be used to reduce the cost of the service to students or to purchase cafeteria equipment. Surplus funds from a-la-carte foods may accrue to the food-service program.</P>
<P>In accordance with the nutritional standards adopted by the Board, the placement of vending machines in any classroom where students are provided instruction, unless the classroom is also used to serve meals to students, is prohibited.</P>
<P>No foods or beverages, other than those associated with the District's food-service program, are to be sold during food-service hours. The District shall serve only nutritious food in accordance with the nutritional standards adopted by the Board.
