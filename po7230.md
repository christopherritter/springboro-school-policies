7230 - GIFTS, GRANTS, DONATIONS
===============================

The Board of Education appreciates individuals or organizations in the
community that may wish to contribute additional supplies or equipment
to enhance or extend the instructional program.

The Board may, by resolution duly passed at a public meeting, accept any
gift or grant of land with or without improvement, and of money or other
personal property, and acknowledge the purpose, if any, for which the
gift was made.

The Board reserves the right to refuse to accept any gift when the
conditions and stipulations connected with it deprive the Board of
control of the gift or when ownership of the gift would not contribute
toward the achievement of the goals of this District.

Any gift accepted by the Board shall become the property of the Board,
may not be returned without the approval of the Board, and is subject to
the same controls and guidelines as are other properties of the Board.

The Board will make every effort to honor the intent of the donor in its
use of the gift, but reserves the right to utilize any gift it accepts
in the best interest of the educational program of the District. In no
case shall acceptance of a gift be considered to be an endorsement by
the Board of a commercial product or business enterprise or institution
of learning.

The Superintendent shall:

A. report to the Board all gifts offered to the School District;

B. prepare fitting means for recognizing or memorializing gifts to the
District as appropriate;

C. establish administrative guidelines implementing the conditions and
limitations upon any gift or donation which has been accepted by the
Board.
