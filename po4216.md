title: 4216 - EMPLOYEE DRESS AND GROOMING
---

{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education believes that employees set an example in dress
and grooming for their students to follow. An employee who follows this
principle improves the importance of his/her task, presents an image of
dignity and encourages respect for authority. These are positive factors
for maintaining discipline.

The Board retains the authority to specify the following dress and
grooming guidelines for employees, as a means of creating a positive
impact on the educational process. All employees shall, when assigned to
District duty:

A. be physically clean, neat, and well groomed;

B. dress in a manner reflecting their assignment;

C. dress in a manner that does not cause damage to District property;

D. be groomed in such a way that their hair style or dress does not
disrupt the educational process nor cause a health or safety hazard.

The employee's supervisor may, at his/her discretion and within the
general guidelines of this policy, establish more definitive guidelines
for dress and grooming necessary for maintaining a professional
atmosphere.

If an employee thinks that an exception to this policy would enable
him/her to carry out assigned duties more effectively, a request shall
be made to the supervisor.

Adopted 3/18/88
