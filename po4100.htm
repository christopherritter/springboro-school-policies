<H1>4100 - EMPLOYMENT OF NONCERTIFICATED PERSONNEL</H1>
<P>One of the most important goals of the Board of Education is to attract and employ personnel of the highest quality in all noncertificated positions. It is the feeling of the Board that candidates selected for employment in the School District, regardless of position, must be devoted to the education and welfare of children. Furthermore, the Board wishes to employ personnel who are motivated to do their best work at all times. In all cases, the Superintendent shall recommend the best qualified person for the position, regardless of the background, experience, residence, and relationship to present employees or members of the Board.</P>
