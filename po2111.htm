<H3>2111 - PARENT AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT</H3>
<P>The Board of Education recognizes and values parents and families as the children's initial teachers and decision-makers in education. The Board believes that student learning is more likely to occur when there is an effective partnership between the school and the student's parents and family. Such a partnership between the home and school and greater involvement of parents in the education of their children generally result in higher academic achievement, improved student behavior, and reduced absenteeism.</P>
<P>In accordance with statute and the State Board of Education Parent and Family Involvement Policy, use of the term "families" is used in order to include children's primary caregivers, who are not their biological parents, such as foster caregivers, grandparents, and other family members.</P>
