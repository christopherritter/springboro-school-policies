================

When the District receives a check from a student or parent that, when
deposited, is returned marked "insufficient funds" or "account cleared",
the Treasurer shall provide an opportunity for the payor to a make
proper payment or to arrange for a satisfactory payment schedule. If
payment is not received within thirty (30) days, the payment schedule is
not adhered to, or the monies do not appear to be collectible, the Board

the District's Accounts Receivable and to take appropriate action to
recover the funds. A returned check fee of \$10.00 will be assessed for
each check returned.
