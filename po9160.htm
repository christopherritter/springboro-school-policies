<H3>9160 - PUBLIC ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL EVENTS</H3>
<P>The Board of Education welcomes and encourages members of the community to attend athletic and other public events held by the schools in the District. Due to the need to maintain order and preserve the facilities of the District during the conduct of such events, the Board retains the right to bar the attendance of or remove any person whose conduct may constitute a disruption at a school event. School administrators are expected to call law enforcement officials if a person violates posted regulations or does not leave school property when reasonably requested. In accordance with Board Policy <A HREF='po7440.htm'><B>7440</B></A> and AG 7440B, administrators may use metal detectors and other devices to protect the safety and well-being of participants and visitors.</P>
<P>No alcoholic beverage or other controlled substance may be possessed, consumed, or distributed at any function occurring on Board property.</P>
<P>Raffles and similar forms of fund-raising by District-related organizations may be permitted by the Superintendent in accordance with Policy 9211 - District Support Organizations and Policy <A HREF='po9700.htm'><B>9700</B></A> - Relations with Special Interest Groups.</P>
<P>If a student or adult is asked to leave or is removed from a school event, no admission fees shall be refunded.</P>
<P>Individuals with disabilities shall have an equal opportunity to purchase tickets for events that have been sanctioned or approve by the Board in accordance with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended.</P>
<P>Service dogs used by persons with disabilities are permitted in all District facilities and at all school events. </P>
<P>Smoking and/or the use of tobacco and/or tobacco substitute products is prohibited at any time within any enclosed facility owned or leased or contracted for by the Board, and in areas directly or indirectly under the control of the Board immediately adjacent to locations of ingress or egress to such facilities. Such prohibition also applies to and/or any school-related event.</P>
<P>The Board is aware of the increasing desire of many parents and other members of an audience to use "camcorders" and other audio/visual devices at school events.</P>
<P>Such recordings can be made by parents or other members of the audience without restriction if the performance is not of copyrighted material. However, if the performance is of copyrighted material, recording can be made if the appropriate license authorizing such recordings has been secured in advance by the District. If the performance is of copyrighted material and the necessary license has not been secured in advance by the District, the audience shall be advised before the performance begins that audio and/or video recordings that will be re-broadcast or distributed in any way, such as posting on the internet, are prohibited.</P>
<P>The Board authorizes the Superintendent to establish rules and procedures governing the use of nondistrict audio/visual recording equipment at any District-sponsored event or activity. Such rules are to be distributed in such a manner that members of the audience who wish to record the event are aware of the rules early enough to make proper arrangements to obtain their recordings without causing delay or disruption to an activity.</P>
<P>Any person or organization seeking to film students or a school activity which is not a public event, must obtain prior permission from the Superintendent.</P>
<P>All notices, signs, schedules, and other communications about school events must contain the following statement:</P>
<P>"In accordance with State and Federal law, the District will provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities who wish to attend and/or participate in school events. Such individuals should notify the Superintendent if they require a reasonable accommodation."</P>
