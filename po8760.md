title: 8760 - STUDENT ACCIDENT INSURANCE
---

{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizes that students may suffer injuries in
the course of attendance at school and participation in the athletic and
extracurricular programs of the schools. Accordingly, the Board will
provide such insurance coverage as is authorized by law and will make
available to parents insurance coverage for other contingencies.

The Board will maintain insurance coverage by a qualified insurer at no
cost to the student for injury resulting from accidents sustained in the
course of transportation under the authority of the Board.

The Board will provide parents the opportunity to purchase group
insurance coverage, at no cost to the Board, for injury resulting from
accidents sustained by students in school, on school grounds, at an
activity sponsored by the school, while traveling between home and
school, and in any activity round-the-clock.

Participation shall be voluntary, and in no case shall insurance
coverage be a requirement for participation in any school activity.

The Board requires that parents of students participating in
interscholastic school athletics be required to acknowledge the life
threatening nature of the activity and sign a statement to this effect.

The Superintendent shall notify all parents of District students of the
availability of group insurance from suitable and qualified insurance
carriers.
