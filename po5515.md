{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education recognizing that our students will work and live
in a culturally diverse world believes it is part of our mission to
provide a positive, harmonious environment in which the differences of
individuals are recognized. A major aim of education should be the
development of core values of a democratic society.

In accordance with this aim, the School District will not tolerate
behavior by students which insults, degrades, or stereotypes any race,
gender, disability, physical condition, sexual orientation, marital
status, ethnic group or religion.

Appropriate consequences for offending this policy will be specified in
the student code of conduct of each school building and may include
suspension or expulsion.

Adopted 3/28/01
