<H1>5111 - ELIGIBILITY OF RESIDENT/NONRESIDENT STUDENTS</H1>
<P>The Board of Education establishes the following residency policy for determining eligibility to attend the schools of this District.</P>
<P>The Board shall provide tuition-free education for the benefit of children at least five (5) but under twenty-two (22) years of age whose parents reside in the District and such others as may be eligible pursuant to Federal and/or State law and the policies of the Board, including disabled preschool children who are at least three (3) years of age but not of compulsory school age and who are not currently enrolled in kindergarten.</P>
<P>As used in this policy, the term "parents" means either parent, unless the parents are separated or divorced, in which case the parent means the parent with legal custody of the child. If neither parent has legal custody of the child, parent means person or government agency with legal custody or permanent custody, as defined by Ohio Revised Code.</P>
<P>In addition, the Board shall provide tuition-free education for the benefit of a child whose grandparent(s) resides in the District and who is the subject of a:</P>
<P>A. power of attorney designating the grandparent as the attorney-in-fact; or</P>
<P>B. caretaker authorization affidavit executed by the grandparent that provides the grandparent with authority over the care, physical custody, and control of the child, including the ability to enroll the child in school, consent in all school related matters, and discuss with the District the child’s educational progress.</P>
<P>In accordance with State law, the grandparent shall be considered the &quot;parent&quot; of the child who is the subject of the power of attorney or caretaker authorization affidavit. Additionally, the child may attend the schools of this District until the power of attorney or caretaker authorization affidavit terminates upon the occurrence of one (1) of the following events:</P>
<P>A. one (1) year elapses following the date the document is notarized;</P>
<P>B. the child ceases to reside with the grandparent(s);</P>
<P>C. the document is terminated by court order; or</P>
<P>D. either the child who is the subject of the document or the grandparent dies.</P>
<P>Additionally, the power of attorney terminates if it is revoked in writing by the person who created it. Further, the caretaker authorization affidavit terminates if the parent, custodian, or guardian of the child acts to negate, reverse, or otherwise disapprove of an action or decision of the grandparent(s) who signed the affidavit with respect to the child. It is the responsibility of the grandparent(s) to notify the District within one (1) week of the termination of the power of attorney or caretaker authorization affidavit.</P>
<P>The Board reserves the right to verify each student's residency and other conditions of eligibility for tuition-free education as well as the validity of the claim of any student to an education in the District. In addition, if a student has recently been discharged or released from the custody of the Department of Youth Services (DYS) and is seeking admittance or re-admittance into the District, such students will not be admitted until the records required to be released by DYS to the Superintendent have been received. Within twenty-four (24) hours of admission into the District, the Superintendent shall request a copy of the student’s school records from the school the student most recently attended.</P>
<H3>Nonresident Eligibility for Tuition-Free Education</H3>
<P>A student shall be entitled to attend school in this District free of any tuition obligation under the following circumstances:</P>
<P>A. A child otherwise eligible for attendance whose parent has signed a contract to buy or build a house in this District and provides proper sworn statements explaining the situation shall be enrolled without payment of tuition for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days. The Superintendent is authorized to determine the number of days. The parent shall provide:</P>
<P>1. a sworn statement explaining the situation, the location of the house being purchased or built, and a statement of the parent's intention to reside there upon its completion; and</P>
<P>2. a statement from the builder that the house is being built and its location or a statement from a real estate broker or bank officer confirming that the parent has a contract to purchase, that the parent is waiting upon a closing date, and that the house is at the location identified in the parent's sworn statement.</P>
<P>Such child shall also be eligible to participate in interscholastic athletics, if released by formal action of the district of current residency and the OHSAA.</P>
<P>B. Children under a shared-parenting plan establishing both parents as "residential parents" when the child is residing with the parent, if one (1) parent resides in the District. If a student resides in another school district but attends school in this District (where one (1) parent resides), it is the obligation of the parents to provide transportation for that student from the home of the nonresident parent. Where a court has vested legal custody with only one (1) parent, the child is entitled to attend school tuition-free only in the district in which the custodial parent resides.</P>
<P>C. A child under the age of eighteen (18) years of age who is married and resides in the District.</P>
<P>D. Students at least eighteen (18) but not over twenty-two (22) who support themselves by their own labor, live apart from their parents, reside in the District, and have not successfully completed the District's high school program or their I.E.P.</P>
<P>E. Students who are considered by Federal law to be illegal aliens and/or homeless students who are required to be admitted by Federal law and in accordance with State guidelines.</P>
<P>F. A child with a medical condition that may require emergency medical attention providing a parent is employed in the District and submits the proper certification required by the Board, including a medical statement from the child's physician.</P>
<P>G. A child, living with a resident other than a parent and whose parent is in the armed services outside the State of Ohio, providing the child's parent submits the appropriate affidavit stating that the parent is in the armed forces outside the State of Ohio, intends to reside in the District upon return to the State, and provides the name and address of the person with whom the child will reside. The child may attend school in the District tuition-free for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months. If the parent does not intend to reside in the District, the child may attend school as a tuition student only.</P>
<P>H. A student who is living with a parent under the care of a shelter program for victims of domestic violence located in the District.</P>
<P>I. A nonresident child who has been or is currently being placed for adoption with a resident of this District, unless the adoption has been terminated or another district is required to educate the child.</P>
<P>J. Foreign exchange students participating in a bona fide foreign exchange program.</P>
<P>K. Upon the approval of the Superintendent a Springboro High School student who has become a nonresident student during his/her senior year or during the year s/he has been approved for graduation provided they have been enrolled as a Springboro student for the prior six (6) months. Additionally, transportation for nonresident students will not be provided.</P>
<P>L. A non-resident student under the age of twenty-two (22) is entitled to attend school in the District if the Superintendent of the student's district of residence and the Superintendent enter into a written agreement consenting to the attendance and specifying that the purpose of the attendance is to protect the student's physical and mental well-being or to deal with other extenuating circumstances deemed appropriate by the Superintendents.</P>
<P>If the student is not receiving special education, there shall be no requirement for either District to provide transportation for the student.</P>
<P>Any student admitted by the District under this provision shall be allowed to participate in all District student activities, including interscholastic athletics, on the same basis as any student who has attended the District's schools while of compulsory age.</P>
<P>M. In accordance with State law, the Board may also approve continued attendance on a non-tuition basis, for the remainder of the school year for a child who becomes a nonresident at the time of a parent's death.</P>
<P>N. Additionally, the Board may enroll a child free of any tuition obligation for a period not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days, on the sworn statement of an adult resident of the District that s/he has initiated legal proceedings for custody of the child. If the court fails to grant the adult resident custody, the child shall be removed from school. If the court awards custody to the adult resident, s/he shall produce the journal entry awarding custody and tuition shall be determined in accordance with State law and/or the court order.</P>
<H3>Students Suspended or Expelled from Other District</H3><P>After offering an opportunity for a hearing, the Superintendent, at his/her discretion, may deny admission to a student who has been suspended or expelled from another public school within or outside the State, for the period of unexpired time of suspension or expulsion. If the expulsion is from an out-of-state public school, the lesser of the period of such expulsion or the period of expulsion which would have been applied had the student committed the offense in this District will be imposed. When the suspension or expulsion from the other district has expired, the student is to be admitted providing all other eligibility requirement have been met. This provision also applies to a student who is the subject of power of attorney designating the child's grandparent as the attorney-in-fact or caretaker authorization affidavit executed by the child's grandparent.</P>
<H3>Eligibility of Tuition Status</H3><P>Students who do not meet the definition of resident student or nonresident student eligible for tuition-free education as defined in this policy, may attend the Springboro schools as a nonresident tuition-paying student if the student becomes a nonresident during the final nine (9) weeks of a school year.</P>
<H3>Mandatory Admission/Payment of Tuition</H3>
<P>The Board shall admit students who reside in the District but his/her parents do not reside in the District and tuition payments shall be assessed pursuant to State law if:</P>
<P>A. the student is in the legal or permanent custody of a governmental agency or a person other than his/her natural or adoptive parents;</P>
<P>B. the student resides in a home as defined by State law;</P>
<P>C. the student requires special education;</P>
<P>D. the child resides in the District and the child's parent is in a residential facility, correctional facility, or juvenile placement and the other parent, if living and not in such a facility or placement, is not known to reside in this State.</P>
<H3>Approval</H3>
<P>All requests for tuition status shall be recommended by the Superintendent in writing and approved by the Board.</P>
<H3>Payment</H3>
<P>Tuition rates shall be determined annually as required by Ohio Statutes. If the District admits a student to the District who is not otherwise entitled to attend or whose attendance tuition is not an obligation of another district, the Board shall collect tuition from the student's parents monthly in advance on a daily pro-rata basis. The terms of the payment of tuition and of the student's attendance shall be in writing.</P>
