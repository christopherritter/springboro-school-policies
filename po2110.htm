<H3>2110 - STATEMENT OF PHILOSOPHY</H3>
<P>Education in the Springboro Community City School District is a dynamic, interactive process involving students, faculty, parents, and the community. This educational process uses the facilities and other resources of the School District, but is not limited by them. In particular, volunteerism by parents and community members is encouraged.</P>
<P>The central objective of the Springboro Community City School District is to help young people maximize their potential for success as responsible members of our democratic society, as participants in the free enterprise system, and as individuals who have a strong and positive sense of self-worth.</P>
<P>For the educational process to be effective, it must recognize and adhere to certain philosophical principles. The Board of Education believes that the following are particularly important:</P>
<P>A. The District should strive to provide the best possible education to each student, using public and private funding in the most efficient manner possible.</P>
<P>B. Education should be a continuous, progressive experience for each student throughout all grade levels, with a minimum of transitional difficulties.</P>
<P>C. The academic program must be fully relevant to contemporary society while emphasizing a strong traditional foundation of learning and skill development in the areas of mathematics, reading, and written and oral expression.</P>
<P>D. Motivation of students should be accomplished by creating building blocks of successful activity.</P>
<P>E. Opportunities should be provided for students of differing interests and abilities to progress in different directions and at different rates, without stigma or elitism.</P>
<P>F. Although the District's academic goals must have first priority, the importance of athletic and extra-curricular activities in developing the whole person must be recognized and supported by quality programs. The productive relationship of academic, extra-curricular, and moral development must be emphasized.</P>
<P>G. While it is recognized that each teacher brings to the classroom a unique set of skills, knowledge, and attitudes, the activities in each classroom must mesh with the overall educational program.</P>
<P>H. Programs in the schools must be periodically evaluated to maintain their relevance, improve quality, and identify new educational needs and opportunities.</P>
<P>I. The recruitment, evaluation, and training of administrators, teachers, and other employees should have as its objective the development of a District staff which satisfies the community's desire for excellence.</P>
<P>J. The District should be energetic in its efforts to obtain public input regarding its programs and activities, present, and contemplated.</P>
<P>K. Problem-solving within the District should be vigorous, constructive, and fair to all concerned.</P>
<P>The philosophy described above provides a framework for the development of Board-adopted policies and procedures, and for the operation of an administrative system which mobilizes all the resources available to the District.</P>
