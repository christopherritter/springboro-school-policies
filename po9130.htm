<H3>9130 - PUBLIC COMPLAINTS </H3>
<P>Any person or group having a legitimate interest in the schools of this District shall have the right to present a request, suggestion, or complaint concerning District personnel, the program, or the operations of the District. At the same time, the Board of Education has a duty to protect its staff from unnecessary harassment. It is the intent of this policy to provide the means for judging each public complaint in a fair and impartial manner and to seek a remedy where appropriate. This procedure supplements those established in the collective bargaining agreements in effect.</P>
<P>It is the desire of the Board to rectify any misunderstandings between the public and the School District by direct discussions of an informal type among the interested parties. It is only when such informal meetings fail to resolve the differences, shall more formal procedures be employed.</P>
<P>Any requests, suggestions, or complaints reaching the Board, Board members, and the administration shall be referred to the Superintendent for consideration according to the following procedure or according to approved collective bargaining agreements in effect.</P>
<P>A. First Level<BR><P>
<P>If it is a matter specifically directed toward a professional staff member, the matter must be addressed, initially, to the concerned staff member who shall discuss it promptly with the complainant and make every effort to provide a reasoned explanation or take appropriate action within his/her authority and District administrative guidelines.<BR><P>
<P>The staff member or complainant may request that the administrator or supervisor be present during the discussion, if necessary. If the concern is not resolved after discussion with the staff member, and the administrator/supervisor has not been involved in the discussion, the complainant may then request a conference with him/her. The administrator/supervisor shall make every effort to resolve the complaint at that level within his/her authority and District administrative guidelines.<BR><P>
<P>This level does not apply if the matter involves suspected child abuse, substance abuse, or any other serious allegation which may require investigation or inquiry by school officials prior to approaching the professional staff member.</P>
<P>B. Second Level<BR><P>
<P>If a satisfactory solution is not achieved by discussion with the administrator, a written request for a conference shall be submitted to the Superintendent by the complainant with a copy to the Board in compliance with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement if effect for the employee. This request should include:</P>
<P>1. the specific nature of the complaint and a brief statement of the facts giving rise to it;</P>
<P>2. the respect in which it is alleged that the complainant (or child of the complainant) has been affected adversely.</P>
<P>C. Third Level<BR><P>
<P>Should the matter still not be resolved, or if it is one beyond the Superintendent's authority and requires a Board decision or action, the complainant shall request in writing, a meeting by the Board.<BR><P>
<P>The Board may grant a meeting.<BR><P>
<P>The complainant shall be advised of the Board's decision in a timely manner.</P>
<H3>Matters Regarding a Program or Operation</H3>
<P>If the request, suggestion, or complaint relates to a matter of District or school policy, procedure, program, or operation, it should be addressed, initially, to the building principal or the head of the department who is most directly concerned, and then brought, in turn, to higher levels of authority.</P>
<H3>Matters Regarding Instructional Materials</H3>
<P>If the request, suggestion, or complaint relates to instructional materials such as textbooks, library books, reference works, and other instructional aids used in the District, the following procedures shall be followed:</P>
<P>A. The criticism is to be addressed to the Superintendent in writing, and shall include:</P>
<P>1. author;</P>
<P>2. title;</P>
<P>3. publisher;</P>
<P>4. the complainant's familiarity with the material objected to;</P>
<P>5. sections objected to, by page and item;</P>
<P>6. reasons for objection;</P>
<P>7. in what school and class the material was used;</P>
<P>8. how the material was used.</P>
<P>B. Upon receipt of the information, the Superintendent shall, after advising the Board of the complaint, appoint an advisory committee consisting of: Director of Instruction, principal, parent, student, librarian, and the teacher of the subject.</P>
<P>C. The Superintendent shall be a member ex officio of the committee.</P>
<P>D. The committee, in evaluating the questioned material, shall be guided by the following criteria:</P>
<P>1. the appropriateness of the material for the age and maturity level of the students with whom it is being used</P>
<P>2. the accuracy of the materials</P>
<P>3. the objectivity of the material</P>
<P>4. the use being made of the material</P>
<P>E. The committee's recommendation shall be reported to the Superintendent in writing within ten (10) business days following the completion of the committee work. The Superintendent will advise the complainant in writing of the committee's recommendation, and advise the Board of the action taken or recommended.</P>
<P>F. The complainant may appeal this decision to the Board through a written request to the Superintendent, who shall forward the request and all written material relating to the matter to the Board.</P>
<P>G. The Board shall review the case and advise the complainant in a timely manner.</P>
<P>No challenged material may be removed from the curriculum or from a collection of resource materials except by action of the Board, and no challenged material may be removed solely because it presents ideas that may be unpopular or offensive to some. Any Board action to remove material will be accompanied by the Board's statement of its reasons for the removal.</P>
