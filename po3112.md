title: 3112 - BOARD-STAFF COMMUNICATIONS
---

{{ page.title }}
================

The Board of Education desires to maintain open channels of
communication between itself and the staff. The basic line of
communication, will, however, be through the Superintendent.

A. **Staff Communications to the Board\
**

Communications from staff members to the Board or its committees shall
be submitted through the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall
forward such communications received from staff members to the Board.
This procedure is not intended to deny any staff member his/her
constitutional right of free speech or the right to appeal to or
otherwise address the Board on important matters through established
procedures.

B. **Board Communications to Staff\
**

All official communications, policies, and directives of the Board of
staff interest and concern to the staff will generally be communicated
through the Superintendent, who shall also keep staff members informed
of the Board's concerns, and actions.

C. **Social Interaction\
**

Both staff and Board members share an interest in the schools and in
education generally, and it is to be expected that when they interact at
social affairs and other functions, they will informally discuss such
matters as educational trends, issues, and innovations, and general
activities of the District. However, since Board members are not
authorized to act on behalf of the Board unless in open public session
or when specifically vested with such authority, Board members and
members of the staff should not discuss individual personalities,
personnel grievances, or other complaints. Instead, such matters should
be addressed in accordance with the procedures established in Board
Policy or the collective bargaining agreement.
